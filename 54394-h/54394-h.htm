<p>The proprietor of this book, now verging on four score years, presents
it to the public with an anxious hope that it will be instrumental
in doing much good. To place within the reach of all classes of persons
who desire it, the history of the venerable sages who wisely conceived,
nobly planned and boldly achieved the independence of these
United States, is believed to be a matter of great importance, especially
to the rising generation.</p>

<p>Of those who signed the Declaration penned by Jefferson—the Articles
of Confederation adopted by the Continental Congress, and
the Federal Constitution—not one survives to aid in directing the
destinies of our country. Like leaves in autumn they have descended
to the earth—the winter of death has shut them from this world for
ever. But they have left their bright examples, their shining lights,
their luminous beacons, to guide their successors in the path of duty
and of safety.</p>

<p>Having had the pleasure of seeing all the signers of the declaration
before they made their last bow and retired from the stage of action,
and having had the satisfaction of a personal acquaintance with many
of them, the proprietor has long felt a strong desire to have the history
of the prominent traits of their lives and characters reduced to a single
portable and cheap volume, that should not be an onerous tax upon
the purse or the memory. Such a volume is now presented to the
American public, carefully and impartially prepared—plain in style,
simple in arrangement and republican in its features.</p>

<p>If all obey the precepts suggested, and imitate the examples delineated
upon the following pages, our republic will continue to rise
sublimely, until it reaches an eminence of power and grandeur before
unknown among the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>That this may be the happy lot of our country, and that our free
government may be preserved in its native purity, is the sincere and
ardent wish of the proprietor.</p>

<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p>The present is emphatically an era of books. The march of mind
is onward and upward, bold and expanding. The soaring intellect of
man, rising on the wings of investigation and experiment, is seizing
upon the elements in all their varied forms, threatening to unveil and
reduce to subjection the whole <em>arcana</em> of nature. The flood gates of
science are opened, and its translucent stream, rushing through the
magic channel of the press, is illuminating the world with rays of
light, as multiform in their hues as a rainbow. Like that beautiful
phenomenon, some of them attract the delighted gaze of many for a
brief period, then vanish from view for want of reflectives, or dissolve
in thin air for want of stamina—an ominous hint to the present
writer.</p>

<p>He, however, has not aimed at brilliancy or high refinement in
composition, nor has he attempted to create a literary <span class="smcap smaller">GEM</span> to induce
admiration. He has aimed at brevity in the impartial statement of
plain matters of fact, avoiding verbiage and extracting the essence of
the history of the sages of ’76. His work is not designed for the diffusive
crucible of the critic, or the empirical hauteur of the cynic.
To make a <em>useful</em> book has been the ultimatum of his efforts. It has
been his constant purpose to incite a love for moral rectitude, a veneration
for unsophisticated religion and pure patriotism, and a lively
interest in the perpetuity of our union as a free people, by reflecting
the precepts and examples of the revolutionary patriots upon the mind
of the reader, from the truth-telling mirror of their history. To preserve,
in its pristine purity, the liberty they purchased with years of
toil, streams of blood and millions of treasure, is a duty imposed upon
us by the law of nature, and by the great Jehovah. To imprint this
deeply and strongly upon the heart of every reader, the author has interspersed
many practical remarks, and, in some instances, compared
the past with the present time.</p>

<p>If the amputating knife, the scalpel and the probe have occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
been used, a sincere desire to do good has prompted their application.
To remove the unsound parts of the body politic—should be a
desideratum with every freeman. By shrinking from this duty, we
jeopardize our elective franchise and court the domination of designing
men, who smile that they may betray, and flatter that they may
destroy.</p>

<p>The author has laboured to be concise without being obscure, to
inform the understanding without burdening the memory. He has
introduced many apothegms, intending to improve the mind and mend
the heart. The causes that led to the revolution, its interesting progress,
its happy termination and the formation of our federal government,
are all amply delineated. The character of each of the individuals
who signed the declaration, and of the illustrious Washington
and the bold Patrick Henry, is fully portrayed. The most prominent
acts of their lives are also clearly exhibited. But few of the
biographettes are encumbered with documentary extracts, although
they will be found sufficiently full for all ordinary purposes.</p>

<p>To write the biography of fifty-eight individuals, all engaged in
the accomplishment of a single object, although that object may be
shrouded in refulgent glory—and preserve an interesting variety
without being prolix or verbose, is a task no one can realize without
attempting it—a task that the author does not claim the credit of having
performed. To compensate for any want of diversity, the reader
will find all the important facts contained in more expensive, ponderous
and voluminous works, placed in so small a compass, that they
may be referred to with greater facility than in them.</p>

<p>In the order of the names, it seems most appropriate to place the
author of the Declaration of Independence first. In some instances,
a character of high classic attainments has been placed by the side of
one whose literary advantages were extremely limited, that the reader,
when admiring the dazzling splendour of the former, may contemplate
the equal patriotism and substantial usefulness of the latter.
The names of Messrs. Gwinnett and Ellery, are placed by the side of
each other because of the contrast in their demise.</p>

<p>The Appendix is considered an important affixion, and renders the
work more full and complete. The Farewell Address of Washington
is one of the happiest productions ever penned by mortal man. It
should be read often, not only by the young, but by <em>all</em>—the rich and
the poor—the public officer and the private citizen. It should be rehearsed
in every school and declaimed in every lyceum.</p>

<p>The Constitution of the United States should also be better known;
it should be familiar to every farmer and mechanic, that it may be
better understood and more faithfully adhered to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
Finally, to carry the reader back to first principles, and point plainly
and clearly to the land marks of ’76, as fixed by the signers of the
declaration of our independence, and to rouse the patriot to a just
sense of our blood-bought privileges and the necessity of preserving
them pure and undefiled, has been the constant aim of the author.</p>

<p>If his humble, but honest and earnest efforts shall prove instrumental
in adding one inch of time—one happy hour to our political
existence, or in strengthening one single link of the golden chain of
the glorious <span class="smcap">Union</span> of these United States, he will deem the months
of severe labour devoted to the preparation of this work—<span class="smcap smaller">AS TIME
WELL SPENT</span>.</p>

<p>“When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people
to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and
to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to
which the laws of nature and of nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to
the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel
them to the separation.</p>

<p>“We hold these truths to be self-evident:—that all men are created equal;
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that
amongst these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to
secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their
just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of
government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to
alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on
such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem
most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate
that governments long established should not be changed for light and
transient causes; and accordingly, all experience hath shown, that mankind
are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves
by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train
of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design
to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,
to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies, and such is now
the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government.</p>

<p>“The history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of repeated
injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an
absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a
candid world.</p>

<p>“He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for
the public good.</p>

<p>“He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance,
unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained;
and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p>

<p>“He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts
of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the
legislature, a right inestimable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.</p>

<p>“He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable,
and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of
fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p>

<p>“He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing, with manly
firmness, his invasions on the rights of the people.</p>

<p>“He has refused, for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to
be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned
to the people at large, for their exercise; the state remaining, in the
meantime, exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions
within.</p>

<p>“He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose
obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass
others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new
appropriations of lands.</p>

<p>“He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to
laws for establishing judiciary powers.</p>

<p>“He has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their
offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.</p>

<p>“He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers
to harass our people, and eat out their substance.</p>

<p>“He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies, without the consent
of our legislatures.</p>

<p>“He has affected to render the military independent of, and superior to, the
civil power.</p>

<p>“He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our
constitution and unacknowledged by our laws, giving his assent to their acts of
pretended legislation.</p>

<p>“For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p>

<p>“For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any murders
which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states:</p>

<p>“For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</p>

<p>“For imposing taxes on us without our consent:</p>

<p>“For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
“For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences.</p>

<p>“For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighbouring province,
establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries, so
as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same
absolute rule into these colonies:</p>

<p>“For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering
fundamentally the forms of our governments:</p>

<p>“For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested
with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</p>

<p>“He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection,
and waging war against us.</p>

<p>“He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed
the lives of our people.</p>

<p>“He is, at this time, transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to
complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun, with circumstances
of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous
ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</p>

<p>“He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high seas, to
bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and
brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.</p>

<p>“He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to
bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose
known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and
conditions.</p>

<p>“In every stage of these oppressions, we have petitioned for redress, in the
most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated
injury. A prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may
define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>

<p>“Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have
warned them, from time to time, of attempts by their legislature to extend an
unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances
of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their
native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them, by the ties of our
common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt
our connexions and correspondence. They, too, have been deaf to the
voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the
necessity which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest
of mankind—enemies in war—in peace, friends.</p>

<p>“We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in general
Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the
rectitude of our intentions, Do, in the name, and by authority of the good people
of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these United Colonies
are, and of right, ought to be, free and independent States:—that they are absolved
from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political connexion
between them and the state of Great Britain, is and ought to be, totally dissolved;
and that, as free and independent States, they have full power to levy
war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
acts and things which independent states may of right do. And, for the support
of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence,
we mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred
honour.”</p>

</div>

<hr />
<h2 id="hdr_2" class="nobreak">THOMAS JEFFERSON.</h2>

<p>When the Great Ruler of the universe resolved to set his people
free from Egyptian bondage, he raised up able and mighty men, to effect
his glorious purposes. These he endowed with wisdom to plan, and
energy to execute his noble designs. There is a most striking similarity
between the history of the Israelites, bursting the chains of
slavery riveted upon them by Pharaoh; and that of the American colonies,
in disenthralling themselves, by the aid of Heaven, from the
oppressions of the British king. Like Moses, Washington led his
countrymen through the wilderness of the revolution, and planted
them, when the journey was terminated, upon the promised land of
freedom and independence. Like Moses, he placed his trust in the
God of Hosts, and like him, he was aided and sustained by a band of
sages and heroes, unrivalled in the history of the world.</p>

<p>In the front of this band stood <span class="smcap">Thomas Jefferson</span>, who was born at
Shadwell, Albemarle county, Virginia, on the 24th of April, 1743.
His ancestors were highly respectable, and among the early emigrants
to the Old Dominion. They were true republicans, in affluent circumstances,
and exercised an influence that radiated to a considerable
extent. Thomas was the son of Peter Jefferson, a man much esteemed
in public and private life. The feelings imbibed from him by this son,
were conspicuous at an early age, and decidedly of a liberal character.
From his childhood, the mind of Thomas Jefferson assumed a high
elevation, and took a broad and expansive view of men and things.
He was educated at the college of William and Mary, at Williamsburg;
and was always found at the head of his class. For assiduity
and untiring industry in the exploration of the fields of science, he
had no superior. He analyzed every subject that came under his
investigation, closely and carefully; passing through the opening
avenues of literature with an astonishing celerity. His mind became
enraptured with the history of classic Greece and republican Rome,
and, in early youth, his political opinions appear to have been distinctly
formed, and opposed to every kind of government, tinctured with a
shade of monarchy or aristocracy.</p>

<p>After having completed his collegiate course, he commenced the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
study of law under chancellor Wythe, whose liberal views were well
calculated to strengthen and mature those already preponderating in
the mind of Jefferson. With regard to the oppressions of the mother
country, and the justice and necessity of resistance by the colonies,
their kindred bosoms were in unison. By a thorough investigation of
the science of law and government, Jefferson soon became prepared
to enter upon the great theatre of public action, and into the service
of his injured country. Planting himself upon the broad basis of
Magna Charta, encircling himself within the pale of the British constitution,
he demonstrated most clearly, that the ministry of the crown
had long been advancing, with rapid strides, beyond the bounds of
their legitimate authority, by exercising a tyrannical power over the
American colonies, not delegated to them by the monarchy they corruptly
represented. So conclusive and luminous were his expositions
of chartered rights on the one hand, and of accumulating wrongs on
the other, that he soon became the nucleus of a band of patriots, resolved
on deeds of noble daring—<em>on liberty or death</em>.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-two, he was elected to the provincial legislature,
and commissioned a justice of the peace, which gave him an opportunity
of disseminating his liberal principles to a considerable
extent. He proclaimed himself the unyielding advocate of equal
rights, and had engraved upon his watch seal as his motto, “Resistance
to tyrants is obedience to God.”</p>

<p>By his eloquence and unanswerable reasoning, he soon kindled the
flame of opposition in old Virginia, which increased as tyranny advanced;
and, in 1769, assumed the shape of a resolution, offered and
advocated by Mr. Jefferson in the legislature, <em>not to import a single
article from Great Britain</em>. The boldness and firmness with which
he maintained his position, astonished the adherents of the crown, and
gave a fresh impetus to the glorious cause then in embryo. With
ample pecuniary means, with talents unsurpassed, his soul illumined
with the fire of patriotism, his indignation roused against the hirelings
of the king, his sympathies excited by the sufferings of his country,
Mr. Jefferson was well calculated to become one of the master spirits
of the revolution; one of the giant champions of universal freedom; a
pillar of fire in the cause of liberty, flashing terror and dismay into the
ranks of his enemies.</p>

<p>The plan of organizing committees of correspondence throughout
the colonies, was devised by him in the early part of 1773, and proved
eminently useful in producing unity of sentiment and concert of
action among the patriots. About that time, he wrote and published
“A Summary View of the Rights of British America,” which also set
forth the wrongs inflicted upon his countrymen, in bold and glowing
colours. This he addressed to the king in respectful, but plain and
impressive language, in the following eloquent strain. “Open your
breast, Sire, to liberal and expanded thought. It behooves you to
think and act for your people. The great principles of right and
wrong are legible to every reader: to peruse them, needs not the aid
of many counsellors. The whole art of government consists in the
art of being honest,” etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
So exasperated was Lord Duninore on perusing this article, that he
threatened to arrest its author for high treason. Written and published
during the session of the legislature of which Mr. Jefferson was
an influential member, and finding that resolutions had been passed
by the representatives, quite as treasonable in their character as the
publication in question, his lordship immediately dissolved the farther
action of that body.</p>

<p>The following year, the British ministry, in answer to petitions for
redress of grievances, sent to the assembly of the Old Dominion, a
series of propositions that <em>they</em> termed conciliatory, but which, in truth,
added insult to injury. Their hypocrisy and fallacy were unmasked
and exposed by Mr. Jefferson, in a masterly strain of eloquent and
withering logic and sarcasm, that carried conviction to a large majority
of his colleagues. They were referred to a committee, which reported
an answer, drawn by the author of the declaration of independence,
similar, in its main features, to that much admired document,
which was immediately adopted. The ball of resistance was
put in motion, the electric fluid of patriotism commenced its insulating
powers in the north and in the south; and, extending from sire to
son, from heart to heart, the two streams met in the centre, and rising
in grandeur, formed the beautiful and luminous arch of <span class="smcap">Freedom</span>, with
its chord extending from Maine to Georgia, its versed sine resting
upon the city of Penn. Under its zenith, at the city of Philadelphia,
the continental congress convened, in which Thomas Jefferson took
his seat on the 21st of June, 1775. Although one of the youngest
members of that venerated assemblage of sages and patriots, he was
hailed as one of its main pillars. Known as a man of superior intelligence,
of liberal sentiments, of strict integrity, of stern republicanism,
and of unbending patriotism, his influence was strongly felt and
judiciously exercised. From the beginning, he advocated a separation
from the mother country, and met, at the threshold, every argument
that was urged against it. He considered that allegiance to the
crown had been dissolved by oppression, and the original contract
cancelled by American blood. Submission was no longer a virtue;
the measure of wrongs was filled and overflowing; public sentiment
demanded the dissolution of the gordian knot; and a voice from heaven
proclaimed, “<em>let my people go</em>.”</p>

<p>The following year, the declaration of independence was proposed,
and Mr. Jefferson appointed chairman of the committee to draft a
form. He was requested, by his colleagues, to prepare the important
document. He performed the task with a boldness of design, and
beauty of execution, before unknown and yet unrivalled. The result
of his labour is before the world. Admiring nations have united in
applauding the declaration of our rights, penned by Jefferson, and
sanctioned by the continental congress on the 4th of July, 1776. As
a master piece of composition, as a clear and lucid exposition of the
rights of man, the principles of free government, the sufferings of an
oppressed people, the abuses of a corrupt ministry, and the effects of
monarchy upon the destinies of man, it stands unequalled. Pure in
its origin, graphic in its delineations, noble in its features, glorious in
its career, benign in its influence, and salutary in its results, it has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
become the chart of patriots throughout the civilized world. It is the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ne plus ultra</i><a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> of a gigantic mind, elevated to a lofty eminence by the
finest touches of Creative Power; displaying its boldest efforts, its
brightest conceptions, its holiest zeal, its purest desires, and its happiest
conclusions. It combines the attributes of justice, the flowers
of eloquence, the force of logic, and the soul of wisdom. It is the
grand palladium of equal <span class="smcap smaller">RIGHTS</span>, the polar star of rational <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>,
the Magna Charta of universal <span class="smcap">Freedom</span>, and has crowned the name
of its author with laurels of immortal fame.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> Nothing beyond—the utmost point.</p></div>

<p>In the autumn of 1776, Mr. Jefferson, in conjunction with Dr.
Franklin and Dr. Deane, was appointed a commissioner to the court
of France, for the purpose of forming a treaty of alliance. Ill health
of himself and family, and an urgent necessity for his services in his
native state, induced him to decline the proffered honour, and also to
resign his seat in congress.</p>

<p>He was immediately elected a member of the first legislature of
Virginia convened under its new constitution, and was looked upon
as one of the main bulwarks of her future safety. After taking his
seat in that body, his first business was, to demolish the superstructure
of the judicial code, that had been reared, either by, or under the
supervision of the British parliament. Although sustained and aided by
able and willing colleagues, the great work of revision fell most heavily
upon him. The first bill he introduced was aimed at the slave trade, and
prohibited the farther importation of negroes into Virginia. This act
alone is a triumphant confutation of the accusation often reiterated
against Mr. Jefferson, <em>that he was an advocate of slavery</em>. To its
<em>principles</em> he was always opposed, and submitted to it <em>practically</em> only
by entail. That he struck the first blow at the unhallowed trade of
importing human beings for the purpose of consigning them to bondage,
is a fact beyond dispute. That this was the first grand step
towards a correction of the most cruel features of the <em>traffic</em>, will not
be denied. To transfer those born in America, from one state to
another, bears no comparison to the heart-rending barbarity of dragging
the African from his native home.</p>

<p>He next introduced and effected the passage of bills destroying
entails, the rights of primogeniture, the church as established by the
English law; and also various others, calculated to assimilate the entire
system of jurisprudence in the state, to its new and republican
form of government; amounting, in all, to one hundred and twenty-six,
most of which were passed, and form the present much admired
statutory code of Virginia.</p>

<p>In 1779, he was called to the gubernatorial chair of the Old Dominion,
surrounded by dangers and perils on every side. The British
troops, headed by the proud Tarleton and the traitor Arnold, were
spreading death and destruction over the state, and contemplated the
capture of Jefferson, to cap the climax of their triumphant victories.
Terror and dismay were depicted on the faces of the more timid
patriots, whilst many of the bolder spirits were much alarmed at the
approach of these merciless foes. But the energy and vigilance of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
governor were found equal to every emergency. He rallied the bone
and sinew of old Virginia, who “with hearts of oak and nerves of
steel,” checked the enemy in their bold career of indiscriminate
slaughter. He imparted confidence and vigour to the desponding,
and roused them to bold and noble action. He dispersed the dark
and gloomy clouds that hung over his bleeding state, and inspired the
friends of liberty with fresh and cheering hopes of ultimate success.
So highly were his services appreciated during the eventful period of
his administration, that the members of the legislature entered upon
their records an <em>unanimous</em> vote of thanks to him, for the able and
efficient manner he had performed his public duties, expressing their
high opinion of his superior talents, strict rectitude, and stern integrity.</p>

<p>In 1783, Thomas Jefferson again took his seat in congress, and became
one of its brightest ornaments. The chaste and moving address
from that body to Washington, when he surrendered his commission,
was from the soul-stirring pen of Jefferson. He was chairman of the
committee appointed to form a plan of territorial government for the
extensive regions of the then “far west.” True to his favourite principle
of finally emancipating the sable African, he introduced a clause
prohibiting slavery after the year 1800, in any of the territories, or
states that should be formed from them.</p>

<p>In May, 1784, Mr. Jefferson was appointed a minister plenipotentiary,
to aid Messrs. Adams and Franklin, in the important duties of
negotiating treaties of commerce with several European nations. He
embarked in July following for France, and arrived there on the 6th
of August. During his stay he visited several of the foreign courts,
but spent the largest portion of his time in Paris. He commanded
the highest respect and esteem wherever he went. He was made a
welcome guest in the halls of literature, legislation, and jurisprudence.
He was received with marked distinction by courtiers and kings, and
effected much towards the promotion of the commercial interests of
the infant Republic he so ably represented.</p>

<p>He was at Paris when the French revolution commenced, and was
often consulted by the leading members of the national convention,
relative to the best course to be pursued, in order to establish their
government upon the firm basis of republicanism. So far as was consistent
with his situation, he gave his opinion freely in favour of rational
liberty.</p>

<p>On the 23d of November, 1789, he returned to his native land, and
was received with great enthusiasm and affection by his fellow citizens.
Soon after his arrival, he was induced to resign his commission
as minister to France, and accept the responsible situation of Secretary
of State under President Washington. The appointment showed
the sagacity of the chief magistrate, and proved a lasting blessing to
our country. Familiar with every principle of government; comprehending,
at one bold view, the requisites necessary to perfect and
perpetuate the new confederation, he was enabled to propose amendments
to the constitution that were subsequently adopted, with some
suggested by others; and to do much to beautify and reduce to harmonious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
system, the new order of things. Well versed in the usages
of diplomacy, international law, and the policy of European courts,
he was prepared to plant the permanent landmarks of foreign intercourse
that have guided our nation to the present time in safety, and
raised her to a degree of greatness before unknown, in so short a period.
A reciprocity of commerce and honourable peace with foreigners,
and a rigid neutrality with belligerents, carefully avoiding ambiguous
or entangling alliances, were some of his leading principles. To submit
to nothing that was clearly <em>wrong</em>, and to ask for nothing but
what was unquestionably <em>right</em>, was a doctrine of Jefferson, forcibly
inculcated in his able correspondence with the French ministers,
during the brief period of their republic. The motto is still nailed to
the flag staff of the star spangled banner, and is handed down from
sire to son in its native purity.</p>

<p>To the domestic concerns of his country he devoted a laborious and
laudable attention. He insisted upon the adoption of a uniform system
of currency and of weights and measures, and suggested many
other improvements, predicated upon plain and enlightened premises,
and all designed to advance the best interests of the American system.
He pointed to the importance of securing and protecting fisheries, and
of encouraging enterprise in all the branches of industry. He demonstrated
the advantages of every species of commerce, and the
necessity of preventing others from monopolizing such sources as
legitimately belonged to the United States. He showed, in a masterly
exposition of existing facts, the increasing policy of European
courts, in restricting the intercourse of America, and their evident
designs of engrossing trade. He submitted to congress an able and
elaborate report, showing great foresight, close observation, and deep
investigation, relative to the privileges and restrictions of the commercial
intercourse of this with other countries. It received great attention,
was a subject of long and animated discussion in congress, and
became the foundation of a series of resolutions introduced by Mr.
Madison, embracing the doctrines it contained, and forming the great
line of demarcation between the <em>old</em> school federal and republican
parties.</p>

<p>Having served his country long and faithfully, and having contributed
largely in placing her on the high road of prosperity and freedom,
Mr. Jefferson retired from public life on the 31st of December,
1793, and, for a season, enjoyed the more substantial comforts of the
domestic circle at Monticello. He took especial care to impart comfort
to all around him, and treated his slaves in the kindest manner,
thus reducing to practice the mode of treatment towards them he had
so often alluded to in theory. The education of his children, the cultivation
and improvement of his estate, and the resumption of scientific
research, gave to him an exhilarating consolation he had long desired,
and which is never found in the arena of public business and political
bustle.</p>

<p>His manner of life at the period alluded to, is happily described by
the Duke de Liancourt, a distinguished French gentleman who visited
him at Monticello, and who wrote a narrative of his tour in the United
States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
“His conversation is of the most agreeable kind, and he possesses
a stock of information, not inferior to any other man. In Europe, he
would hold a distinguished rank among men of letters, and as such he
has already appeared there. At present he is employed with activity
and perseverance in the management of his farms and buildings, and
he orders, directs, and pursues, in the minutest detail, every branch
of business relating to them. I found him in the midst of harvest,
from which the scorching heat of the sun does not prevent his attendance.
His negroes are nourished, clothed, and treated as well as
white servants could be. Every article is made on his farm; his negroes
being cabinet makers, carpenters, and masons. The children
he employs in a nail manufactory, and the young and old negresses
spin for the clothing of the rest. He animates them all by rewards
and distinctions. In fine, his superior mind directs the management
of his domestic concerns, with the same ability, activity, and regularity,
which he evinced in the conduct of public affairs, and which he
is calculated to display in every situation of life.”</p>

<p>During his recess from the toils of public life, Mr. Jefferson was
unanimously elected president of the American Philosophical Society,
a circumstance that was highly gratifying to him. It afforded him
much pleasure to occupy the chair that had been long and ably filled
by his revered friends, the illustrious Franklin and the philosophic
Rittenhouse. He proved himself, in every way, worthy of the honour
conferred. After a repose of three years, Mr. Jefferson was again
called upon by his fellow citizens to mount the theatre of public
action. President Washington had proclaimed his determination to
retire to the peaceful shades of Mount Vernon, and leave the presidential
chair to a new incumbent. The people had become divided
politically, and each party determined to nominate a candidate for the
high and responsible station about to become vacant. Mr. Jefferson
was selected by the democrats, and Mr. Adams by the federalists.
The election resulted in the choice of Mr. Adams for President, and
of Mr. Jefferson for Vice President. As the presiding officer of the
Senate, he discharged his duty with dignity and impartiality. Familiar
with parliamentary rules, he was uniformly prepared to decide
such questions as came before him, promptly, and generally to the
satisfaction of the members.</p>

<p>At the next presidential election, he was again a candidate in opposition
to Mr. Adams. The mountain waves of party spirit rolled over
the United States like a mighty torrent. Each party presented a bold
front regardless of danger, pressed on by a rear rushing to conflict.
The political campaign terminated in favour of the democrats, who
returned an equal number of votes for Mr. Jefferson as President, and
Aaron Burr as Vice President. This singular circumstance imposed
the election of the chief magistrate upon the House of Representatives.
To defeat the election of the great leader of the popular party, some
of his opponents voted for Mr. Burr. A most spirited contest ensued,
and thirty-five ineffectual ballotings were made. The ambition of the
latter gentleman for promotion, at last so much subsided, as to induce
him to withdraw from a farther contest with the man of the people’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
choice; and, on the thirty-sixth ballot, Mr. Jefferson was duly elected
President, and Mr. Burr Vice President; the former by a majority of
eight votes.</p>

<p>The following extract from his inaugural address will show with
what sentiments he entered upon the performance of his arduous
duties.</p>

<p>“Equal and exact justice to all men, of whatever state or persuasion,
religious or political; peace, commerce, and honest friendship
with all nations; entangling alliances with none; the support of the
state governments in all their rights, as the most competent administrations
for our domestic concerns, and the surest bulwarks against
anti-republican tendencies; the preservation of the general government
in its whole constitutional vigour, as the sheet anchor of our
peace at home and safety abroad; a zealous care of the right of election
by the people, a mild and safe corrective of abuses which are
lopped by the sword of revolution where peaceable remedies are unprovided;
absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority, the
vital principles of republics, from which there is no appeal but to force,
the vital principle and immediate parent of despotism; a well disciplined
militia our best reliance in peace, and for the first moments of
war till regulars may relieve them; the supremacy of the civil over
the military authority; economy in the public expense, that labour
may be lightly burthened; the honest payment of our debts and sacred
preservation of the public faith; encouragement of agriculture and of
commerce as its handmaid; the diffusion of information and arraignment
of all abuses at the bar of public reason; freedom of religion,
freedom of the press, and freedom of the person under the protection
of the habeas corpus; and trial by juries impartially selected. These
principles form the bright constellation which has gone before us, and
guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation. The
wisdom of our sages and blood of our heroes have been devoted to
their attainment. They should be the creed of our political faith, the
text of civic instruction, the touchstone by which to try the service of
those we trust, and should we wander from them in moments of error
or of alarm, let us hasten to retrace our steps and to regain the road
which alone leads to peace, liberty, and safety.”</p>

<p>Here is a statesman’s chart, drawn by one of the ablest navigators
that ever stood at the helm of government. His soundings were frequent;
his observations were made with mathematical exactness; he
combined experience with science, and traced his lines with boldness
and precision. To follow its directions is to ensure safety.</p>

<p>Based upon these principles, practically carried out, the administration
of Jefferson became popular, peaceful, and prosperous. He knew
the reasonable desires of the people, and exerted his noblest energies
to provide for them. He knew that the art of governing harmoniously,
consisted in an enlightened honesty, and acted accordingly.
He anticipated the future wants of the rising and expanding republic
over which he presided, and proposed, in his annual and special messages
to congress, wise and politic measures to meet them. So satisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
was his course to his fellow citizens, that he was re-elected to
a second term, by a majority of one hundred and forty-eight.</p>

<p>His inaugural address, on that occasion, enforced the same principles
contained in his first, and manifested a deep and growing interest
in the welfare and prosperity of his country. As his belief in a Supreme
Power has been questioned by some, the following extract, containing
the same sentiment found in all his writings where this subject
is alluded to, may correct those who are labouring under an error on
this important point. Hear him, after invoking the aid of congress in
the affairs of the nation: “I shall need, too, the favour of that Being
in whose hands we are, who led our forefathers, as Israel of old, from
their native land, and planted them in a country flowing with all the
necessaries of life; who has covered our infancy with his providence,
and our riper years with his wisdom and power.”</p>

<p>If all who profess the religion of the cross, discarded sectarianism
and honoured unsophisticated <em>practical</em> piety as much as did Thomas
Jefferson, the prospect of christianizing the world would soon burst
upon us with refulgent brightness. The partition walls of various
creeds, drawn from the same pure fountain, and coloured by fancy
and construction, would be dissolved by heaven-born charity, and the
superstructure of the Redeemer’s kingdom would rise from their
mouldering ruins in majesty sublime.</p>

<p>Soon after Mr. Jefferson entered upon the duties of his second term,
a portentous storm darkened the horizon of his country, charged with
the forked lightning of discord. In consequence of being disappointed
in obtaining the presidential chair amidst the confusion he created
when Mr. Jefferson was first elected, and superseded by Mr. Clinton
as vice president at the expiration of four years, Aaron Burr mounted
upon the whirlwind of his wild ambition, and attempted the formation
of a new republic in the Spanish provinces on the Mississippi; apparently
aiming at an ultimate division, if not dissolution of the United
States. Although he was acquitted, after being tried for high treason,
owing to his deep cunning in not committing the <em>overt</em> acts necessary
to convict, yet the dark stigma of a traitor is marked upon the splendour
of his brilliant talents, in traces so deep, that time, nor angels’
tears, can never remove it. Like a comet, propelled by its own centrifugal
force from its constitutional orbit, he fell to rise no more, and
our country was preserved from his Catiline grasp.</p>

<p>About the same time, France and Great Britain were at war, both
of which, and more especially the latter, had repeatedly insulted the
American flag under various but unwarranted pretences. Redress
was promptly demanded, and measures pursued to obtain it. Anxious
to preserve the peace of his country, but determined to vindicate her
rights and maintain her dignity, Mr. Jefferson, whilst he prosecuted
a vigorous negociation for the arrangement of a friendly intercourse
and the adjustment of existing differences, prepared for the final alternative
of war. He knew well the importance to England of the
importing and exporting trade, and as a means of bringing her to honourable
terms, recommended to congress the embargo law, which
was passed on the 22nd of December, 1807. This measure was violently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
assailed by the opponents of the administration. It, however,
had a salutary effect upon the British government, and caused a relinquishment
of the most odious features of the assumptions of power
that had been set up, followed by more conciliatory propositions on
the part of England, for a final settlement of all difficulties and
wrongs. Thus situated were the foreign relations of the United
States when the second term of Mr. Jefferson expired, at which time
he bid a final farewell to public life, and left the destinies of his beloved
country in other hands. He had been an efficient and faithful
labourer in the vineyard of American liberty for nearly forty years;
he left it richly covered with foliage and fruit; in the full bloom of
its vigour and health; enclosed by the palisades of honesty and truth;
and adorned with the crowning glory of patriotism and philanthropy.</p>

<p>On the 3d of March, 1809, Thomas Jefferson surrendered the responsibilities
of chief magistrate, ceased to be the active statesman,
withdrew from the political arena, and again became a private citizen,
surrounded by the halo of his country’s gratitude, consoled by the
approbation of a pure conscience, and cheered by the plaudits of admiring
millions.</p>

<p>From that time forward, he declined all public honours, and remained
in peaceful retirement till the day of his death, seldom leaving
his favourite Monticello. But he did not enter upon a life of inglorious
ease. The same innate activity that had marked his brilliant
career from his youth, the same nobleness of mind and energy of character
that had raised him to the loftiest pinnacle fame could rear,
still prompted him to action. He immediately reduced his time to a
harmonious arrangement, and his whole business to the most perfect
system. He uniformly rose before the sun, and held a supervision
over all the concerns of his plantation. The various publications from
his pen, during the period of his retirement, show that he laboured
arduously in the fields of science and philosophy. For the promotion
of literature and general intelligence he opened an extensive correspondence
with men of letters, in this country and in Europe. He
considered the diffusion of knowledge, among the great mass of the
human family, the greatest safeguard against tyranny and oppression,
the purest source of earthly bliss, and the surest passport to freedom
and happiness.</p>

<p>Acting from this impulse, he submitted the plan of a University to
the legislature of Virginia, to be erected at Charlottesville, a town
situated at the foot of the mountain that reared its romantic scenery
in front of his mansion. It was to be built with funds raised by donations
from individuals and from the state, himself to be a liberal contributor.
The plan of the buildings, the course of instruction, the
mode of discipline, the duties and accountabilities of the officers and
instructors, were all devised and drawn by Mr. Jefferson, and were
so much admired and approved by the members of that legislative body,
that they passed an act authorizing its adoption, and appointed its
author Rector, to carry the design into effect. Upon the completion
of that object he then devoted all necessary time, and <em>more</em> money
than strict prudence called for. It became the doating object of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
old age, and his strongest efforts were exerted in its accomplishment.
These were crowned with success, and he had the happiness to live
and see the University completed and filled with students. The
course of instruction was designed to prepare the scholars for the
general routine of business, both public and private, without being
strictly classical. The library was selected by him with great judgment
and care, and was confined to what may be termed <em>useful</em> books,
treating upon subjects necessary to be understood by every citizen, to
prepare him to discharge properly the duties he owes to himself, his
family, his country, and his God. A catalogue, written by the hand of
Jefferson, is still there, and carefully preserved. He exercised a parental
care over this institution as long as his physical powers would
permit; and was often seen viewing it with an exquisite pleasure and an
honest pride. Much of his time was devoted to visiters, to whom his
hospitality was liberally and kindly extended. Thousands of his own
countrymen paid their grateful respects to him, and Europeans of distinction
thought their tour in the United States incomplete, until they
took by the hand the <span class="smcap smaller">PATRIOT</span>, the <span class="smcap smaller">SAGE</span>, the <span class="smcap smaller">PHILOSOPHER</span>, and the <span class="smcap smaller">PHILANTHROPIST</span>
of Monticello. To delight, to instruct, and to please, he
was peculiarly calculated. He was familiar with every subject; his
mind united the vigour of youth with the experience of age; the
strength of a giant with the innocence of a babe. The broad expanse
of the universe, the stupendous works of nature, the Pierian
fields of science, the deep recesses of philosophy, and the labyrinthian
avenues of the intellect of man, seemed spread before him like a map
of the world. He was an encyclopedia of the age he adorned, a lexicon
of the times he enlightened, and one of the brightest diadems in
the crown of his country’s glory.</p>

<p>With calm dignity and peaceful quietude, Mr. Jefferson glided
down the stream of time towards the ocean of eternity, until he
reached the eighty-fourth year of his age. Forty-four years had rolled
over his head, since his amiable companion, the daughter of Mr.
Wayles, an eminent lawyer of Virginia, had slumbered beneath the
clods of the valley. One of two interesting daughters, the only children
he ever had, was also resting in the silent grave. The charms
of earth began to fade before him, and he felt sensibly that he was fast
approaching the confines of another and a better world. The physical
powers and mechanical structure of his frame were fast decaying; the
canker worm of disease was doing its final work; and the angel of
death stood over him with a keen blade, awaiting Jehovah’s signal to
cut the thread of life, and set the prisoner free. Early in the spring
of 1826, his bodily infirmities increased, and from the 26th of June
to the time of his decease, he was confined to his bed. He then remarked
to his physician, “my machine is worn out and can go no
longer.” His friends who attended him, flattered themselves that he
would again recover, but <em>he</em> was convinced that his voyage of life was
about to close, and that he would soon cast his anchor in the haven
of rest. To those around him he said, “do not imagine that I feel
the smallest solicitude as to the result. I do not indeed <em>wish</em> to die,
but I do not <em>fear</em> to die.” To his last moments, he manifested a peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
anxiety for the future prosperity of the university which he had
founded, regarding it as the youngest child of his old age. Assured
that it would receive the fostering care of the state, he could say, now
Lord, dismiss me. On the 2nd day of July, his body became extremely
weak, but his mental powers remained as clear as a crystal fountain.
He called his family and friends around him, and, with a cheerful
countenance and calm dignity gave directions for his funeral obsequies.
He requested that he might be interred at Monticello, without
pomp or show, and that the inscription upon his tomb should only
refer to him as “The author of the Declaration of Independence, of
the Statutes of Virginia securing religious freedom, and as the father
of the University.” He then conversed separately with each of his
family: to his surviving daughter, Mrs. Randolph, he presented a
small morocco case, which he requested her not to open until after
his death, and when opened, was found to contain a beautiful and
affectionate poetic tribute to her virtues.</p>

<p>The next day, being told it was the 3d of July, he expressed a desire
that he might be permitted to inhale the atmosphere of the 50th anniversary
of our national freedom. His prayer was granted, the glorious
4th of July, 1826, dawned upon him, he took an affectionate
leave of those around him, and then raising his eyes upward, articulated
distinctly, “I resign myself to God, and my child to my country,”
and expired as calmly as an infant sleeps in its mother’s arms,
without a murmur or a sigh. Thus lived and thus died <span class="smcap">Thomas Jefferson</span>,
universally esteemed in life, and deeply mourned in death by
a nation of freemen; deeply lamented by every patriot in the civilized
world.</p>

<p>In person, he was slender and erect, six feet two inches in height;
light and intelligent eyes; noble and open countenance; fair complexion;
yellowish-red hair, and commanding in his whole appearance.
In all the relations of public and private life, he was a model
of human talent and rigid integrity, rarely equalled and never surpassed.
His whole career was calm and dignified. Under all circumstances
his coolness, deliberation, and equanimity of mind, placed
him on a lofty eminence, and enabled him to preserve a perfect equilibrium,
amidst all the changing vicissitudes and multiform ills that
flesh is heir to. He kept his passions under complete control, and
cultivated richly the refined qualities of his nature. His philanthropy
was as broad as the human family; his sympathies were co-extensive
with the afflictions of Adam’s race. He was born to be useful; he
nobly fulfilled the design of his creation.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_3">JOHN HANCOCK.</h2>
</div>

<p>Biography is a subject of such thrilling interest, that the memory
of most men, in every age and nation, who have rendered themselves
eminent, either in the cause of virtue or vice, glory or infamy, has
been handed down on the pages of history. Among the unlettered
nations of the earth, we find the exploits of their heroes and sages
recorded with hieroglyphics, in wild simplicity; or find their names
interwoven in the wild and more romantic tales of mysterious tradition.
When graced with truth and impartiality, the subject is not only interesting,
but calculated to enrich our minds, by producing a desire
to emulate the examples of the great and good, and by pointing out to
us the paths of error, that lead us to disgrace and ruin. The interest
felt in the history of an individual, depends much upon the manner
the biographer performs his important and responsible duty, but more
upon the sphere of action and the magnitude of the cause in which
the individual has been engaged. The <em>cause</em> in which <span class="smcap">John Hancock</span>,
the subject of this brief sketch, was engaged, is one deeply interesting
to every philanthropist, and more especially to every American. It
was the cause of humanity and equal rights, opposed to cruelty and
oppression; the cause of American Independence, opposed to British
tyranny. The <em>part</em> he acted, was alike creditable to his head and
heart; his fame is enrolled on the bright list of the illustrious patriots
of the revolution.</p>

<p>He was a native of Massachusetts, born near Quincy, in 1737. His
father, of the same name, was a clergyman, eminent for his piety, and
highly esteemed by the parishioners under his charge. He died during
the infancy of his son, and left him under the guardianship of his
paternal uncle, who treated him with all the tenderness of a father,
and continued him at school until he graduated at Harvard College
in 1754. His uncle was a merchant of immense wealth, and, on the
completion of his studies, placed him in his counting-house, that he
might add to his science a knowledge of business, of men, and of
things. In 1760, he visited England, saw the mortal remains of
George II. laid in the silent tomb, and the crown placed upon the
head of his successor. He continued in the business of his uncle until
the age of twenty-seven, when his patron and benefactor died, leaving
him his vast estate, supposed to be the largest of any one in the province.</p>

<p>He was, for many years, one of the select men of Boston; and, in
1766, was elected a member of the General Assembly of Massachusetts.
He there exhibited talents of a superior order, which attracted
the attention, excited the admiration, and gained the esteem of his
colleagues. They also excited the jealousy and irony of his enemies,
who soon put him in the crucible of slander and persecution; but, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
a long trial, he came out like gold seven times tried; he was weighed
in the scale of justice, and not found wanting.</p>

<p>As a proof of the high estimation in which he was held when in the
assembly, he was placed on the most important committees of that
body, and was uniformly chairman. He was also elected speaker, but
the governor, who was jealous of his liberal principles, put a veto
upon his appointment.</p>

<p>His intelligence had led him to investigate the laws of nature, of
God, and of man; he arrived at the conclusion, that men are endowed
by their Creator with certain inherent privileges, that they are
born equal, and they of right are and should be free. He drank deep
from the fountain of liberal principles, and was among the first to repel
the blind and cruel policy of the mother country, and rouse his
fellow men to a sense of impending danger.</p>

<p>Although deeply interested in commercial business, and more exposed
to the wrath of kingly power than any individual in the province,
he boldly placed himself at the head of associations for prohibiting
the importation of goods from Great Britain. The other provinces
caught the fire from these examples; and, to these associations
may be traced the preliminaries of the tragic scene, that resulted in
the emancipation of the enslaved colonies of the pilgrim fathers.</p>

<p>As an evidence that John Hancock was a leading patriot at that
time, the first seizure that was made by the revenue officers, under
pretence of some trivial violation of the laws, was that of one of his
vessels. The excitement produced by this transaction was so great,
that a large number collected to rescue the property. It was moved
under the guns of an armed ship, ready charged, to repel any attack.
But the popular fury rose like a thunder gust from the western horizon;
they rushed to the onset; brought away the vessel, razed to the
ground some of the houses occupied by the custom-house officers, and
burnt, in triumph, the boat of the collector. This fire was, for a time,
smothered by the mantle of authority, but it was never extinguished;
it was the fire of Liberty. It only required to be fanned by the impolitic
oppression that eventually blew it into curling flames.</p>

<p>To prevent the recurrence of a similar scene, several regiments of
British troops, with all their loathsome vices fresh upon them, were
quartered amongst the inhabitants. This was like pouring pitch on a
fire to extinguish it. The stubborn and independent spirits of Boston
were not to be <em>awed</em> into subjection. The consequences were tragical.
On the evening of the 5th of March, 1770, a party of these
soldiers fired upon, and killed a number of the citizens, who had collected
to manifest their indignation against those they <em>hated</em> more than
they <i>feared</i>. Had an earthquake shook the town to its very centre,
the agitation could not have been greater. Had it been melting before
devouring flames, the commotion could not have increased.</p>

<p>The tolling of bells; the groans of the wounded and dying; the
shrieks of widows, mothers, and orphans; the flight of soldiers; the
rush of the inhabitants; the cry of vengeance, urged on by popular
fury; all combined to render it a scene of confusion and horror, upon
which imagination dwells and sickens; beneath which, description<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
quails and trembles; at the sight of which, humanity bleeds at every
pore. It is a commentary, strong and eloquent, upon the impropriety
of quartering soldiers amongst citizens, of maintaining civil law by
military force, and of intruding upon the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sanctum sanctorum</i><a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> of private
and domestic peace.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> Holy or sacred place.</p></div>

<p>On the following day, a meeting of the inhabitants was held; a
committee was appointed, at the head of which were Hancock and
Samuel Adams, instructed to request the governor to remove the
troops from the town. He at first refused, but finding, under existing
circumstances, that discretion was the better part of valour, he
ordered their removal. This, with promises that the offenders should
be brought to condign punishment, prevented further hostilities at
that time.</p>

<p>The awful and imposing solemnities of interring those who were
killed, was then attended to. Their bodies were deposited in the
same tomb; tears of sorrow, sympathy, and a just indignation, were
mingled with the clods as they descended upon the butchered victims;
and the event was, for many years, annually commemorated with
deep and mournful solemnity. A <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">te deum</i> and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">requiem</i> were chanted
to their memory, and the torch of liberty was replenished at their
tomb.</p>

<p>At one of these celebrations, in the midst of the revolution, John
Hancock delivered the address. A few brief extracts will give the
reader some idea of the feelings and sentiments that pervaded his
bosom, and of his powers as an orator and a statesman.</p>

<p>“Security to the persons and property of the governed, is so evidently
the design and end of civil government, that to attempt a logical
demonstration of it, would be like burning a taper at noon day,
to assist the sun in enlightening the world. It cannot be either virtuous
or honourable to attempt to support institutions of which this
is not the great and principal basis.”</p>

<p>“Some boast of being friends to government: I also am a friend to
government, to a righteous government, founded upon the principles
of reason and justice; but I glory in avowing my eternal enmity to
tyranny.”</p>

<p>He then proceeded to portray, in vivid colours, the wrongs inflicted
by the mother country, and urged his fellow citizens to vindicate their
injured rights.</p>

<p>In speaking of the Boston massacre, his language shows the emotions
of his heaving bosom, the feelings of his indignant soul.</p>

<p>“I come reluctantly to the transactions of that dismal night, when,
in such quick succession, we felt the extremes of grief, astonishment,
and rage; when Heaven, in anger, suffered hell to take the reins; when
Satan, with his chosen band, opened the sluices of New England’s
blood, and sacrilegiously polluted her land with the bodies of her guiltless
sons.</p>

<p>“Let this sad tale never be told without a tear; let not the heaving
bosom cease to burn with a manly indignation at the relation of it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
through the long tracts of future time; let every parent tell the story
to his listening children, till the tears of pity glisten in their eyes, or
boiling passion shakes their tender frames.</p>

<p>“Dark and designing knaves, murderous parricides! how dare you
tread upon the earth which has drunk the blood of slaughtered innocence
shed by your hands? How dare you breathe that air, which
wafted to the ear of heaven the groans of those who fell a sacrifice to
your accursed ambition? But if the labouring earth doth not expand
her jaws; if the air you breathe is not commissioned to be the minister
of death; yet, hear it and tremble! the eye of heaven penetrates
the darkest chambers of the soul, and you, though screened from human
observation, must be arraigned, must lift your hands, red with
the blood of those whose death you have procured, at the tremendous
bar of God.”</p>

<p>His boldness greatly exasperated the adherents of the crown, and
every artifice was put in requisition to injure his growing popularity.
Amongst them, was his nomination by the governor, who had uniformly
been his enemy, to the council, hoping, by this stratagem, that
he would, by his acceptance, turn the populace against him. By a
prompt refusal he defeated the intrigues of his enemies, and riveted
himself more strongly on the affections of those who favoured liberal
principles, rendering himself more obnoxious to the king’s officers.
He was at this time captain of the governor’s guard, and was immediately
removed. As a testimony of respect to him, his company;
composed of the first citizens of Boston, dissolved themselves at once.</p>

<p>The tocsin of the revolution was now sounded from the heights of
Lexington; American blood had again been shed by British soldiers;
the people heard the dread clarion of revolution; thousands rushed
to the rescue; the hireling troops fled; in their flight, they found the
messengers of death stationed on their whole route; retribution met
them at every corner; the trees and fences were illumined by streams
of fire from the rusty muskets of the native yeomanry; and many of
Briton’s proud sons slumbered in the arms of death on that memorable,
that eventful day.</p>

<p>The governor, on the reception of this news, issued his proclamation
in the name of his most Christian Majesty, George the III., declaring
the province in a state of rebellion, but graciously offering
pardon to all returning penitents, excepting John Hancock and Samuel
Adams, who had also rendered himself obnoxious by his patriotic and
independent course. A secret attempt was made to arrest them, but
was foiled. These two philanthropists were preserved to aid in the
glorious cause they had boldly and nobly espoused, and to become
shining lights in the blue arch of liberty, and bright examples of patriotism
to future generations. Their proscription by the governor only
served to endear them still more to their friends and their bleeding
country. In 1774, John Hancock was unanimously elected President
of the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts; and, in 1775, he was
called to preside over the Continental Congress. He accepted this
appointment with diffidence, there being many of its number much his
senior, and of eminent talents. He, however, succeeded in discharging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the arduous duties assigned him, with fidelity and great ability,
and to the satisfaction of his colleagues and his country.</p>

<p>His was the only name affixed to the Declaration of Independence
when it was first published and presented to the fearless patriots for
their approval; and it stands first in bold relievo, on a thousand facsimiles,
scattered through the world. It stands at the head of a list
of sages, whose names are enrolled in unfading glory, and will be
handed down to the remotest ages of time, unsullied and untarnished.</p>

<p>Impaired in his health and worn down by fatigue, Mr. Hancock
resigned his station in Congress in October, 1777, having presided
over that august body for two years and a half, with a credit to himself,
gratifying to his friends, and advantageous to the cause of human
rights.</p>

<p>Soon after he returned home, he was elected to a convention of his
native state to form a constitution for its government. His experience
and talents were of great service in producing a truly republican
instrument. In 1780, he was elected the first governor under the
new constitution, and continued to fill the gubernatorial chair for five
years, when he resigned. After two years he was again elected, and
continued to fill this station, with dignity and usefulness, during the
remainder of his life. During his administration over the destinies
of his dear native state, there were many difficulties to overcome, many
evils to suppress. The devastations of the war had paralyzed every
kind of business; reduced thousands from affluence to poverty; polluted
the morals of society; and left a heavy debt to be liquidated.
Many conflicting interests were to be reconciled; many restless
spirits were to be subdued; and many visionary theories were to
be exploded. Insubordination, arrayed in a faction of 12,000 men,
threatening to annihilate the government, was the most prominent evil
to be removed. Abuses and riots were of frequent occurrence; the
civil authorities were disregarded; and it was found necessary to call
out the militia to preserve order. By the prudent management of
Governor Hancock, these difficulties were adjusted, the clamour of
the people hushed, their complaints silenced, order restored, and but
few lives sacrificed at the shrine of treason.</p>

<p>For a time, the governor, by his firm and determined course, incurred
the displeasure and enmity of many prominent men; but when reason
resumed her station, and prosperity began to alleviate the burdens
that had been so strongly felt, their ire was appeased, the sour feelings
of party spirit lost their rancour, and admiration and esteem for his
sterling virtues and talents, and the long and arduous services he had
rendered his country and his state, disarmed his enemies of their resentment,
and produced uniform love and esteem.</p>

<p>He used his best exertions in favour of the adoption of the federal
constitution, and, to cap the climax of his well earned fame, he left a
sick bed on the last week of the session of the Assembly of his state,
and, by his vote and influence, induced them to accept and sanction
that important instrument of confederation, that has thus far held us
in the bonds of union, strength, and power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
Governor Hancock now had the satisfaction of seeing prosperity
spread its benign influence over the whole infant republic, and her
institutions, laws, trade, manufactures, commerce, and agriculture,
based on the firm pillars of freedom and eternal justice. His long
nursed vision was reduced to a happy reality; he felt that he could die
in peace; and, on the 8th of October, 1793, his soul took its flight
suddenly and unexpectedly, to join the kindred spirits that had gone
before, to enter upon the untried scenes of the eternal world. He
continued to serve his country to the last, and, if a particle of malice
against him lingered in the dark bosom of any man, it was buried with
him in the tomb. Governor Hancock was amiable in his private character;
highly honourable in his feelings; gentlemanly in his deportment;
fashionable in his style of living; fond of innocent amusements,
but free from corrupting vices; liberal and charitable; a friend to the
poor, the oppressed, and the distressed; diligent in business; open and
frank in his disposition; a faithful companion; a public spirited citizen,
and a consistent man.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_4">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.</h2>
</div>

<p>The name of <span class="smcap">Benjamin Franklin</span>, conspicuous upon the pages of
European and American biography, ever commands peculiar respect
and veneration. It is surrounded with a rich variety, as rare as it is
instructive and interesting.</p>

<p>Franklin was born at Boston, on the 17th of January, 1706, exactly
ninety years before my humble self. His father was among the puritans
who fled before persecution, and sought repose in the wilds of
Massachusetts. His parents were poor, but honest and esteemed.
Poverty is ever inconvenient, but has not always been a disgrace.
Honesty and industry were formerly the brightest stars on the
escutcheon of fame.</p>

<p>Franklin manifested a taste for improvement at an early age, and
exhibited talents of a superior order. His pious parents encouraged
his education as far as their limited means would permit, and were
anxious to see him prepared for the pulpit; but necessity compelled
his father to take him from school at the age of ten years, and place
him in his shop, to aid him in the prosecution of the chandler business.
But this did not paralyze his native genius. Original in every trait
of his character, eccentric in his manner, and the child of nature and
experiment, he commenced the study of practical philosophy, amidst
candle wicks, tallow, and soap. He went through the experiments
of ascertaining the precise quantity of sleep and food requisite to supply
the wants of nature, and the kind most conducive to health. At
this early age, he adopted rules of temperance, frugality, and economy,
worthy of imitation, and adorned with all the system of mature age.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
He also accustomed himself to meet and bear disappointments with
philosophic fortitude. He continued to improve his mind by reading,
for which he had an insatiable thirst. Nothing passed by him unnoticed,
and his expanding genius drew philosophy from nature, from
things, and from men. He reasoned, analyzed, moralized, and improved,
from every thing he saw. Hence the vast expansion of his
gigantic genius, comprehending at one bold view, through after life,
the philosophy of mind, of nature, of science, of art, of government,
of society, and all the relations of creation, from the dust under his
feet, through the myriads of animalculæ in a drop of water, up to
the bright seraphs of the skies. A mind like his could not long be
confined in a chandler’s shop. Open and honest in his disposition, he
communicated his wish of moving in some other sphere, to his father.
After an examination of the various trades, and working a short time
with a cutler, he was bound to his brother, to learn the art of a
printer. He soon became master of his profession, and left a shining
example for all apprentices, by adding to his industry in business the
improvement of his mind during every leisure hour—a happy prelude
to his glorious and useful career through future life.</p>

<p>So intensely bent on the acquisition of knowledge was Franklin,
that he often preferred his book to his meal, and studied whole nights,
in defiance of the commands and entreaties of Morpheus. As he was
paid a weekly sum for his board, he adopted a course of simple vegetable
diet, by which he saved money to purchase books. He manifested
a correct taste and a sound judgment in the selection of authors
and subjects. Among them, he studied with admiration and attention
the Memorabilia of Xenophon, and became one of the closest imitators
of Socrates, in his mode of reasoning and habits of life, to be found
on record. Before he became versed in the rules of propriety, he
often gave offence by the bold and obstinate manner in which he advanced
and maintained his opinions.</p>

<p>He now commenced his literary career; and, as is most usually the
case with young authors, he offered his first sacrifice to Calliope, in a
strain of rhyming ideas. His poetry was applauded, but his father,
who was a man of sound judgment, cured him of his poetic mania, by
turning his verses into ridicule; at the same time encouraging him to
improve his talents by writing prose. Suspicious of his own ability,
fearing the shafts of criticism, he managed to have several of his
productions published in the paper edited by his brother, in so clandestine
a manner, that no one could know the author. When he
found they met with general admiration, his vanity, as he says, did not
let the world long remain ignorant of the writer.</p>

<p>Being flattered by praise and attention from others, he began to feel
his importance, which resulted in an open rupture between him and
his brother, to whom he was an apprentice. For some time, he endured
a course of harsh treatment, but at length resolved to free himself
from the chains of bondage. He soon found an opportunity of embarking
for New York, where he arrived in safety. Not being able to obtain
business there, he bent his course towards the city of Philadelphia,
on foot, and alone. On his arrival there, he had but one solitary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
dollar left; was a stranger, and only seventeen years of age; and,
without business, must soon be dependent on the cold charities of the
world for his bed and board. On entering Market street, his eccentric
appearance excited the gaze of the multitude, as much as his
towering talents subsequently did the gaze of the world. He had a
roll of bread under each arm, and, approaching the Delaware, he sat
down and feasted upon his bread and the pure water from the river.
His pockets were projected to an enormous size with the various articles
of his wardrobe, and, on the whole, his corpulent appearance was
not in bad keeping with old Boniface.</p>

<p>Although there were but two printing offices in Philadelphia, he
succeeded in obtaining employment in one, as compositor. He now
reduced all his theories of economy to successful practice, maintaining
himself at a trifling expense, pursuing a correct and industrious career,
which gained for him the esteem of all his acquaintances. Among
others, his talents attracted the attention of Sir William Keith, then
Governor of the province, who invited him to his house and treated
him with great kindness.</p>

<p>The governor was a man whose liberality in <em>promises</em>, often went
beyond the means of his <em>purse</em>. Anxious to see his young friend placed
in more auspicious circumstances by his benefaction, he proposed to
set him up in business, and sent him to London, with letters of high
commendation, to obtain the necessary materials for his new enterprise.
On his arrival there, he was much chagrined to find that no
pecuniary arrangements were made by his new benefactor, and he
found himself in a strange land without money to enable him to return.
But this was only another lesson of experience, in whose school
he delighted to study; and, instead of sitting down under the weight
of disappointment and dejection, he soon obtained employment, and,
by his skill and industry, gained the confidence and esteem of all
his new acquaintances. After residing there for eighteen months he
took passage for Philadelphia on the 22nd of July, 1726. On his
way home he concocted a set of rules to govern his actions through
future life, of the following substance:</p>

<p>I resolve to be frugal; to speak truth at all times; never to raise
expectations not to be realized; to be sincere; to be industrious; to
be stable; to speak ill of no man; to cover, rather than expose the
faults of others; and to do all the good I can to my fellow men.</p>

<p>Upon this foundation of native granite he built a superstructure, as
beautiful and enduring as the proudest memorials of Greece and
Rome.</p>

<p>He arrived at Philadelphia on the 11th of October, and engaged
with the merchant, who owned the goods brought in by the ship in
which he came, as a clerk. The same industry and success attended
him in the counting-house that cheered him at the press, showing
clearly that his talents were of a rare and rich variety. His future
prospects in this new department brightened before him, but were suddenly
prostrated by the death of his employer, which threw him back
into his former trade. For a few months he worked for his old master,
but finding a partner who had more money than skill, they commenced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
business on their own account. His industry and exertions
were now put in full requisition: he manned his own wheelbarrow in
collecting materials for business, and put nature on short allowance,
until he should acquire enough to be free from debt. His industry,
punctuality, and correct deportment, gained him many valuable and
influential friends, through whose patronage he was enabled to extend
his business, and shake off his partner, who had become worse than
worthless, by embarrassing and retarding the business of the firm.
Up to this era in his life, Franklin had been emphatically fortune’s
foot-ball. His life had been a complete checker-board of changing
vicissitudes, blasted hopes, and keen disappointments. But, amidst
all the stormy trials that had tossed his youthful bark to and fro, surrounded
by the foaming torrents of vice, he never became tarnished
by corruption, or degraded by the commission of a base or mean
action. The moral principles deeply planted in his bosom by parental
instruction during his childhood, were as lasting as his life; a
happy illustration of the good effects of faithfulness in parents towards
their children.</p>

<p>Having now become liberated from his partner in business, he began
to feel the necessity and propriety of choosing another, to fill up the
vacuum in his side, and share with him the joys and sorrows that
awaited him on this mundane sphere of action. Accordingly, in 1730,
he entered into a partnership for life with a widow lady, whose maiden
name was Read, and for whom he had contracted an attachment previous
to her first marriage. In him she found a kind husband, and in
her he found a much more agreeable partner than his former one.</p>

<p>Philanthropy predominated in the heart of Franklin; to better the
condition of his fellow men, was pleasure to his soul. The rules
governing the “Junto,” formed by him, and now merged in the Philosophical
Society, show a superior knowledge of human nature,
and of the duty men owe to the creature and the Creator. They
breathe universal charity, kindness, benevolence, and good will to all
mankind. Among them is one for the suppression of intemperance,
a prophetic prelude to the exertions of the present day in this cause.</p>

<p>Franklin had profited by the experience of the past, and was now
enabled to steer clear of the numerous rocks and quicksands of error,
on which so many are ruined and lost. Although he rode in many a
storm, prosperity beamed upon him from this time onward, through a
long life of usefulness. His new partner smiled upon him, his friends
esteemed him, and in the pleasures of the present, past pains were
forgotten.</p>

<p>In 1732, he commenced the publication of “Poor Richard’s Almanac,”
which he continued until 1737, circulating 10,000 copies annually.
Although under an humble title, it was a work of great merit,
being replete with maxims and rules calculated for every day use in
the various relations of life. It gained great celebrity in Europe, and
was translated into various languages.</p>

<p>About this time he commenced the publication of a newspaper,
which was conducted with great ability, free from all scurrility, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
a messenger of truth. Would to God the same could be said of <em>all</em>
the public prints of the present day.</p>

<p>He continued to pursue his studies, until he added to general science
a knowledge of the French, Italian, Spanish, and Latin languages.
By the “Junto” a small library was commenced, which
formed the first stepping stone to the present city collection. He
wrote and published a highly interesting pamphlet on the necessity of
a paper currency, and added much to his literary fame by the production
of various essays, written in his truly original style. He filled,
successively and successfully, the situation of state printer, clerk of
the General Assembly, and post-master of Philadelphia. He used
unwearied exertions to increase municipal improvement in the city, by
the organization of fire companies, lighting and improving the streets,
regulating the watch, and reducing every thing to that system, order,
and harmony, so congenial to his mind. He was the patron and father
of the Philosophical Society, the Pennsylvania University and Hospital;
and contributed, in every way he could, to advance the glory
and prosperity of his adopted home, and the happiness and peace of
his fellow citizens. All the important enterprises, both in the city
and province, during these days of his towering fame, were either
originated by him, or were more rapidly advanced by his wisdom and
counsel; and scarcely any project was undertaken without his approving
sanction.</p>

<p>In 1741, he commenced the publication of a “General Magazine,”
which contained much useful matter, but was less acceptable than his
previous writings, being in part devoted to the litigated points of divinity.</p>

<p>The mechanic arts were also much improved by him. He brought
to their aid philosophy and chemistry, and combined them with science,
economy, and nature. He improved the chimneys, constructed
a stove, and proposed many useful and economical corrections in domestic
concerns, from the garret to the cellar, from the plough to the
mill. Science acknowledged his master spirit, the arts hailed him as
their patron, the lightning bowed in subjection to his magic rod, and
nature claimed him as her favourite son.</p>

<p>In 1744, he was elected a member of the provincial assembly, where
he was continued for ten successive years. Although not a popular
speaker, his clear head and sound judgment, as a legislator and a
statesman, gave him an influence over that body before unknown.</p>

<p>During the years he was serving his country in the assembly, he
also served in the fields of experimental philosophy, and explained
many of the mysterious phenomena of nature, that spread his fame to
the remotest bounds of the civilized world. His discoveries in electricity
alone, were sufficient to have immortalized his name. He was
the first man on record who imparted magnetism to steel—melted
metals, killed animals, and fired gunpowder by means of electricity;
and the first who conceived and reduced to practice, the method of
conducting lightning from the clouds to the points of steel rods, and,
by them, harmless to the ground. All the elements and fluids, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
air, sea, and land, underwent the close investigation of his vast, his
philosophic mind.</p>

<p>In 1758, he was sent to Carlisle to conclude a treaty with the Indians;
and in the following year, to Albany, to meet a congress of
commissioners, to arrange means of defence against the threatened
hostilities of the French and savages. He there submitted a plan that
met with the unanimous approbation of the commissioners, but was so
republican in its features, as to be rejected by those who had at heart
the interests of their king more than the happiness of the colonists.</p>

<p>On the decease of the deputy post-master general of America,
Franklin succeeded him, and raised the department from a state of
embarrassment and expense, to a fruitful source of revenue to the
crown.</p>

<p>About this time difficulties arose between the proprietors and government
in the province of Pennsylvania, which were finally referred
to the mother country for adjustment, and Franklin was sent to England
in June, 1757, as advocate for the province. With his usual
industry and address, he performed the duties of his mission, the difficulties
were adjusted, and in 1762, he returned, received a vote of
thanks from the assembly, and a compensation of five hundred pounds.
He was now variously employed in regulating the post-office department,
making treaties with the Indians, and devising means of defence
on the frontiers: every department of government feeling his
beneficial influence. New difficulties arose between the assembly
and the proprietors, and, in 1764, Franklin again sailed for England,
with instructions to obtain the entire abolishment of proprietary authority.
On his arrival there, he was called upon to perform more
important and perilous duties. The plan for taxing the colonies had
been long agitated, and was now matured by the British ministry.
This project Franklin had opposed from the beginning, and he was
now arraigned to answer numerous accusations brought against him
by the enemies of liberty. On the 3d of February, 1766, he appeared
before the House of Commons to undergo a public examination. He
was found equal to the task; his enemies were astounded at his logic,
boldness, dignity, and skill; and his friends were filled with admiration
at the able manner he confuted every accusation, and defended
the rights and interests of his native country. Amidst the attacks of
artifice and insolence of power, he stood unmoved, and firm as a
marble statue. He remained in England eleven years as the agent
of the colonies, opposing the encroachments of the crown upon the
rights of Americans; and, during the whole time, all the combined
efforts of malice, flattery, and intrigue, were unable to ensnare or intimidate
him. He became acquainted with the etiquette, corruptions,
and devices of diplomacy; but never bent his knee to Baal, or kissed
the hand of a crowned head.</p>

<p>Matters had now arrived at a crisis that induced his departure for
his long neglected home. His personal safety in England, and the
need of his public services in his own country, admonished him to
return. He accordingly embarked, and arrived at Philadelphia in
the beginning of May, 1775. He was received with marked attention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
and esteem, and immediately elected to the continental congress,
adding new lustre and dignity to that august body, and enrolling his
name among the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Notwithstanding
he had used every exertion to reconcile difficulties with
Great Britain, and believed his country was yet too weak to achieve
its independence, his course was now onward, resolved, with his
patriotic colleagues, on liberty or death.</p>

<p>The talents of Franklin were now had in constant requisition, both
by his own state and in the general congress. He was always selected
to meet the agents of the crown, who were at various times commissioned
to offer terms of inglorious peace. They always found in him
the firm uncompromising advocate of liberty; the shrewd and wary
politician; the bold and zealous defender of the rights of his bleeding
country. The disasters of the American army during the campaign
of 1778, induced congress to apply to France for assistance. All eyes
were turned on Franklin to perform this important mission. In October,
1776, he embarked upon this delicate embassy, and, after a
most vigilant intercession, succeeded in concluding a treaty of alliance
with that nation, on the 6th of February, 1778, to the great joy
of himself and his suffering countrymen. When the news of this
alliance reached England, the ministry were much alarmed, and despatched
messengers to Paris to endeavour to induce Franklin to enter
into a compromise. All was in vain. To Mr. Hutton and others,
who came to him with the olive branch of peace, he replied: “I never
think of your ministry and their abettors, but with the image strongly
painted in my view of their hands red and dropping with the blood of
my countrymen, friends and relations. No peace can be signed by
those hands, unless you drop all pretensions to govern us, meet us on
equal terms, and avoid all occasions of future discord.”</p>

<p>He met all their intrigues at the threshold, and they became convinced
that the hardy yeomanry of America were not to be dragooned,
flattered, or driven from the bold position they had assumed. During
the numerous interviews he had with these emissaries, (I can call them
by no milder term,) Franklin was cautioned by Mr. Heartley to beware
of his personal safety, which had been repeatedly threatened.
He thanked his friend and assured him he felt no alarm, that he had
nearly finished a long life, and that the short remainder was of no
great value. He ironically remarked: “Perhaps the best use such an
old fellow can be put to, is to make a martyr of him.”</p>

<p>If it required much skill and perseverance to <em>negociate</em> an alliance
with France, it required more to <em>preserve</em> it. A republican form of
government is ever repugnant to kingly power. That the French in
America would imbibe liberal principles, was a matter of course. That
the thrones of Europe would be endangered on their return, was truly
predicted. By this course of ingenious reasoning, the British ministers
exerted a powerful influence against the continuation of the alliance.
But the eagle eye of Franklin penetrated, anticipated, and
frustrated all their dark schemes of intrigue; and, in the event, they
were compelled to comply with his terms of peace, acknowledge the
independence of the colonies, and retire, defeated, disgraced, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
humbled. In the arduous duties of settling definitive preliminaries
of peace, Franklin was aided by Messrs. Adams, Jay, and Laurens.
These duties were closed, and a definitive treaty concluded with
Great Britain and the United States at Paris on the 3d of September,
1783.</p>

<p>Although anxious to be discharged from further public service, it
was not until 1785, that Franklin was permitted to return to his beloved
country, where he could breathe the pure air of republican freedom,
no longer polluted by kingly power. During this time he had
concluded treaties between the United States and the kings of Sweden
and Prussia. On his departure from Europe every mark of respect
was paid to him by kings, by courts, by the literati, and by all classes
of society that the most towering ambition could desire. He was
clothed with the mantle of love and unfading glory. His reputation
was perched sublimely on the loftiest pinnacle fame could rear. He
had been a pillow of fire to the American cause, and a pillar of smoke
to the enemies of human rights.</p>

<p>At the age of eighty years, borne down by fatigue and disease, he
returned to Philadelphia. He was hailed with enthusiastic joy, esteem,
and respect by all the friends of liberty, from the humblest citizen up
to the illustrious Washington.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his advanced age, and his great anxiety to retire
from the public gaze, he was soon appointed Governor of Pennsylvania—and
subsequently, in 1787, elected a delegate to the convention
that framed the federal constitution. Many of the bright traits of that
matchless instrument received their finishing stroke from his master
hand. Early in 1790, his infirmities of body confined him to his room,
but his immortal mind remained unimpaired. When approaching
rapidly the confines of eternity, he still looked with anxious solicitude
upon the interests of the young republic. He still continued to
benefit mankind by his writings and counsels. Some of the strongest
and most vivid productions from his pen were written during his
confinement. His diseases continued to increase, and on the 17th of
April, 1790, calm and resigned, cool and collected, peaceful and
happy, he resigned his spirit into the hands of his Creator—quitted
this vale of tears, and slumbered, quietly and sweetly, in the arms of
death—in the full faith of rising to a glorious immortality in realms
of bliss beyond the skies.</p>

<p>By his will he prohibited all pomp and parade at his funeral. He
was anxious that the plain republican manner of his long and useful
life, should be strictly observed in the mournful obsequies of his interment.
He was buried on the 21st of April, in the north-west
corner of Christ Church yard, where a plain marble slab, even with
the surface of the earth, points to where he lies. With his, moulders
the dust of his wife, with whom he had lived in harmony and peace.
No other inscription is upon the tomb except his and her name.</p>

<p>His death was deeply lamented throughout the civilized world.
Congress ordered mourning to be observed throughout the United
States one month. The event was solemnized, and many eulogies
pronounced in France. The National Assembly decreed that each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
of its members should wear a badge of mourning on the occasion for
three days. The sensations produced there by his death, were as imposing
and interesting, and celebrated with as much devotion as those
recently witnessed in our own country on the death of La Fayette.</p>

<p>In reviewing the life of this great benefactor of mankind, we find a
richer variety to admire than in that of any individual upon the historic
page. In whatever station he moved he was a luminary of the
first magnitude. He entered upon the stage of action at a time when
the world needed just such a man; and continued upon it just long
enough to finish all he had begun. He was found just equal to every
work he undertook, and always stopped at the golden point of the
finishing stroke—a modest hint for me to close. You who profess to
admire his virtues, talents, and usefulness, prove your sincerity by
imitating his examples.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_5">ROGER SHERMAN.</h2>
</div>

<p>The man who has been rocked in the cradle of letters from his
childhood; who has become familiar with general science, the classics,
and philosophy; who has had a father to aid, and friends to caress him;
whose path has been smoothed by uninterrupted prosperity—and does
not ascend the ladder of fame, is either untrue to himself, or destitute
of native talent. With all the advantages of an education lavished
upon him, he sinks into obscurity, and the fond anticipations and future
hopes of a doting parent, set in gloom.</p>

<p>When, on the other hand, we see a man, whose opportunities for
acquiring an education during childhood and youth carried him not
far beyond the confines of the spelling book; a man, who had no father
or guardian to warn him against the quicksands of error or point him
to the temple of science; his intellect enveloped in the rude attire of
nature’s quarry at the age of twenty; when we see such a man bursting
the chains that bind his mental powers—divesting himself of the
dark mantle of ignorance—unveiling his native talents, and shining in
all the beauty of intelligence and greatness—we are filled with admiration
and delight.</p>

<p>Such a man was <span class="smcap">Roger Sherman</span>, the great-grandson of Captain
John Sherman, who came from England to Watertown, Massachusetts,
in 1635. Roger was born in Newton, Massachusetts, on the
19th of April, 1721. His father, William Sherman, was a respectable
farmer, with means too limited to educate his son, and, at an
early age, bound him to a shoemaker. Like Franklin, at the age of
nineteen, he wandered from his master to seek his fortune, and like
him, he had a genius that no shop could confine, no obstacle intimidate,
or difficulty paralyze. The course of his mind was onward, upward;
like a new and blazing star, illuminating the horizon as it rose.
Nature designed him to be great and good; he obeyed her dictates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
He went to New Milford, in Connecticut, where he followed shoe-making
three years, living within the strictest rules of economy, contributing
from his earnings to the support of a widowed mother, with
a family of small children. The education of his young brothers and
sisters, also received his attention. Every leisure moment he devoted
to books, often having one open before him when using his lap stone.
With each succeeding day, his mind expanded, unfolding beauties
rich and rare. Every obstacle to the pursuit of knowledge, melted before
his untiring industry; he ascended the hill of science with a firm
and steady pace.</p>

<p>In June, 1743, he removed his mother and her family to New Milford,
and entered into the mercantile business with an elder brother—still
pursuing his studies as opportunities permitted. He soon stored
his capacious memory with a fund of rich and useful information, that
ultimately placed him on the pinnacle of public esteem and usefulness.
About that time, he made a public profession of religion, which
he adorned through subsequent life. In 1745, he was appointed surveyor
of Litchfield county, having made himself familiar with mathematics.
Like his contemporary and friend, Benjamin Franklin, he
made the calculations of an almanac several years, for a publisher in
New York.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-eight, he married Miss Elizabeth Hartwell,
of Staughton, Massachusetts, who died in 1780, leaving seven children.
He subsequently married Miss Rebecca Prescott, who lived
to have eight children, all of whom, with those by his first wife, he
carefully trained in the ways of wisdom and virtue. He also supported
his mother, and a maiden sister whose health was poor, until death
relieved them, at an advanced age, from the toils of life.</p>

<p>In the prosecution of his literary pursuits, he turned his attention
to the study of law, in which he made astonishing proficiency. In
1754, he was admitted to the bar, better prepared to act well his part
and do justice to his clients, than many who are ushered into notice
under the high floating banners of a collegiate diploma.</p>

<p>The following year he was appointed a justice of the peace and
elected a member of the colonial assembly; an honour that was conferred
upon him during the remainder of his residence at that place.
He was highly esteemed by his fellow citizens. His reputation as a
lawyer and statesman stood high, and his private worth enabled him
to exercise a salutary influence upon those around him. For industry,
sound logic, prudence, and discretion, he stood unrivalled in the colony.
Strong common sense, the true helm of human action, marked
his whole career; rendering him substantially and extensively useful
to his fellow men and his country. He was a philanthropist of the
highest order, a patriot of the purest water.</p>

<p>In 1759, he was appointed a judge of the county court of Litchfield,
and discharged his official duties with great faithfulness and impartiality,
correcting vice and promoting virtue.</p>

<p>Two years after, he removed to New Haven, where he was appointed
justice of the peace, elected to the assembly, and, in 1765, was
placed upon the judicial bench of the county court. He received the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
degree of master of arts from Yale College, of which he was treasurer
for many years, fulfilling the trust with scrupulous honesty and
fidelity.</p>

<p>In 1766, he was elected a member of the executive council, which
was hailed as an auspicious event by the friends of liberal principles.
The mother country had manifested a disposition to impose unjust
taxation upon the Americans. It required discernment, experience,
nerve and decision, to comprehend and oppose the corrupt plans of an
avaricious ministry. The colonies had borne the main burden of the
French war, in which they had sacrificed large sums of money and
fountains of their richest blood. After years of incessant toil, the foe
had been conquered, an honourable peace for England obtained, the
frontier settlements in a measure relieved from danger, and the soldier
again became the citizen.</p>

<p>Whilst their rejoicings on that occasion were yet on the wings of
echo, oppression from the crown threatened to blast their fond anticipations
of happiness and repose, and bind them in chains, more to be
dreaded than the tomahawk and scalping knife.</p>

<p>This colony had furnished more money and men, and lost more of
her bravest sons in the French war than any other with the same
population. Mr. Sherman had been an active member of the assembly
during the period of its prosecution, and remembered well the sacrifices
that had been made to gratify the king. He understood perfectly
the rights of his own country and those of the crown. He was eminently
prepared to discover approaching danger and sound the alarm.
He was well calculated to probe the intrigues and venality of designing
men, although the Atlantic rolled between him and them.</p>

<p>Mr. Grenville, who was at the head of the British ministry, determined
to reduce his long-nursed theory of taxing the American colonies,
to immediate practice. The alarm was immediately spread.
Appeals for redress, petitions, and remonstrances, numerously signed,
were forwarded to parliament; but all in vain. Reason and justice
were dethroned and mercy banished from her seat. The car of
oppression moved onward; the stamp act was passed; the indignation
of the colonists was roused. After much exertion and excitement,
<em>this</em> law was repealed, to the great joy of the Americans; but they
soon found that the storm was only lulled to gather new strength, and
pour down its wrath upon their devoted heads with tenfold fury. The
year following a duty was laid upon tea, glass, paper, and paints.
High toned chords were then touched, and their reverberation reached
the heart of every freeman. The tea was hurled into the ocean
and the law set at open defiance. This spirited opposition induced a
repeal of these duties, except on the first named article. This exception
was death to the colonial power of England; to America, freedom.
Popular fury increased; kindred spirits united to repel the injury, determined
to defend their liberty, regardless of consequences. Amidst
these commotions, Mr. Sherman remained undaunted at his post,
watching, with a calm and prophetic mind, the moving elements.
Although elevated to the bench of the superior court, he remained in
the executive council, a firm and consistent advocate of his country’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
rights; a lucid delineator of Britain’s wrongs. He viewed the gathering
clouds as they rolled in fury; he saw the lightning of revenge
streaming fearfully, without the tremor of a muscle, coolly awaiting
the event, relying on Heaven, trusting in God.</p>

<p>High handed and tyrannical measures were now adopted by Parliament.
Laws were passed, violating the chartered rights of the colonists,
subversive of reason, humanity, and justice. A volcanic storm
gathered; the British lion prowled in anger: the Albion Goliah buckled
on his armour; the shining steel dazzled in the sun; the sword of vengeance
was drawn; colonial blood was spilt; popular fury was roused;
allegiance was dissolved; America was free.</p>

<p>At this momentous, this thrilling crisis, a band of sages and patriots
assembled at Philadelphia, to devise means for the safety of their
bleeding country. In the front rank stood Roger Sherman, in all the
dignity of his native greatness. He was a member of the first continental
Congress, and remained firm and unwavering at his post, during
the trying scenes of the revolution, the formation of the new government,
and the adoption of the federal constitution. With a
gigantic mind, improved and enlarged by a rich fund of useful knowledge,
inured to all the toils and intricacies of legislation, the history
of his country and of nations spread upon his memory, the ingratitude
and insults of a foreign monarch preying upon his soul, he was prepared
to render his country services, equalled by few, exceeded by
none.</p>

<p>His capacity was equal to every emergency: he shrunk from no
duty; discharged every responsibility assumed; moving, with the mathematical
precision of a planet, within the orbit of sound discretion.
He was familiar with men and things, acquainted with the <em>minutiæ</em>
of human nature, traced causes and results to their true source, and
viewed, with a philosophic eye, the secret springs of human action;
the <em>arcana</em> of economies was open before him; he solved problems,
demonstrated principles, placing them in the full blaze of illustration,
as irresistible as the pages of Euclid. Such was the self-taught
Roger Sherman.</p>

<p>The session of 1775 was one of great labour, anxiety, and embarrassment.
None but “hearts of oak, and nerves of steel,” could have
sustained the tremendous shock, the fearful onset. An army was to
be raised and organized, military stores provided, fortifications erected,
rules of government adopted, plans of operation matured, internal
enemies encountered, and legions of Britain’s bravest veterans to be
repelled. To meet these emergencies, the members of Congress had
hearts full of courage, but a treasury empty and bare. A forlorn hope
was before them—a revenging foe on their shores. But they had resolved
on liberty or death. Nor did they “split on the rock of resolves,
where thousands live and die the same.” They met the fury
of the king, encountering his vials of wrath with a firmness, wisdom,
and patriotism, before unknown; placing them above all Greek, all
Roman fame. Their course was onward towards the goal of <span class="smcap smaller">FREEDOM</span>.
No threats of vengeance dismayed them—the shafts of terror fell harmless
at their feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
In 1776, with the colonies bleeding at every pore; a picture of sad
reverses before them; a conquering enemy sweeping over their land
like a destructive torrent; the streams purpled with the blood of their
brethren; the cries of widows and orphans ringing in their ears; the
sky illuminated by the streaming blaze of their towns; this band of
patriots conceived the bold and towering plan of independence—a
plan that stamped their heads, their hearts, their names, with immortal
fame.</p>

<p>Early in the summer, Messrs. Sherman, Adams, Franklin, Livingston
and Jefferson, were appointed a committee to draft a declaration
of rights. After much deliberation, it was prepared, reported, and,
on the memorable 4th of July, 1776, received the hearty sanction of
the Continental Congress, amidst the transporting joys of freemen,
who hailed it as the bright, the morning star; to them, a prelude of
future bliss; to tyrants, a burning meteor, threatening to devour them.</p>

<p>Illustrious in all their actions, the signers of the declaration were
eminently so, when, assuming their native dignity, they rose, in all
the majesty of greatness, bursting their servile chains; cutting asunder
the cords of oppressive allegiance; sublimely passing the grand
Rubicon; and, in view of an approving Heaven and an admiring
world, declared their country free and independent. The era was
one of resplendent glory, sacred to the cause of human rights, enduring
as the tablet of time, brilliant as the meridian sun. The sages
whose signatures grace the chart of our liberty placed themselves on
the loftiest spire fame could rear. By their own consciences, by their
countrymen, by Heaven, and in view of gazing millions, they stood
approved, applauded, and admired.</p>

<p>No member of the Continental Congress had studied more closely
and comprehended more clearly finance and political economy than
Judge Sherman. His mind was moulded in system, his plans were
judicious, and his habits frugal. He was a practical man and conversant
with every department of government. He was an efficient
member of the board of war, ordnance, and the treasury. In short,
he was placed on the most important committees during the long and
bloody struggle of the revolution. His plans for replenishing the
treasury, regulating expenditures, and disbursing moneys, were based
on rules of economy and frugality, corresponding with the emergency
of the times. Fraudulent contractors shrunk before his penetrating
scrutiny; speculations upon government were often paralyzed by his
torpedo touch; and he guarded, with an eagle eye and a father’s care,
the interests of the young republic.</p>

<p>In the estimation of Washington, the members of Congress, and
of the nation, the talents of Roger Sherman, for sterling integrity
and substantial usefulness, were second to none among the bright
constellations that illuminated the memorable era of ’76. In those
days the ladder of fame was firmly based on honest merit and modest
worth. It required no stump speeches or bar-room harangues to
gain popular favour. The tree was judged by its fruit; <em>principles</em>
and not <em>men</em>, were the political land marks. It was also a time of
labour. Inglorious ease was not known in the legislative halls; long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
written speeches were not read to the speaker and walls of the house:
the business of the nation was the order of the day; that business was
done faithfully, promptly, and effectually. Posts of honour were
then posts of duty; profit was out of the question. The motives and
actions of the revolutionary sages and heroes were not based on the
seven principles of five loaves and two fishes, but on love of country,
social order, and human rights.</p>

<p>By the citizens of his own state the virtues and talents of Mr.
Sherman were held in high estimation. In addition to his congressional
honours, they continued him a member of council during the
war. In 1784, when New Haven received a city charter, he was
elected mayor, filling the office with dignity and usefulness to the
close of his life, when not absent on more important public duties.</p>

<p>At the termination of the war, he, in conjunction with Judge Law,
was appointed to revise the judicial code of Connecticut, which duty
was performed with great ability, and to the satisfaction of all concerned.
He was a member of the general convention that framed the
federal constitution. From a manuscript found amongst his papers,
it appears that this instrument of union received many of its original
features from Mr. Sherman. To his conceptive mind and practical
wisdom, we are much indebted for the towering greatness and unparalleled
prosperity we so eminently enjoy, and which will endure so
long as we are faithful to ourselves. With all the local and conflicting
interests of the colonies spread open to his view, he was enabled
to exercise a salutary influence in reconciling difficulties between the
members, that, for a time, threatened to hurl back the elements of
government into original chaos, and prostrate the fair fabric of liberty.</p>

<p>By examining the profound discussions, the variety of opinions,
the multifarious interests, the intense anxiety, the agony of soul, and
sacrifices of private views that characterized the formation of the
federal constitution, we discover wisdom, discretion and patriotism
of the purest, loftiest kind, shining in all the grandeur of bold relievo.</p>

<p>Based upon the declaration of rights, it forms a superstructure
towering in sublimity above all others, radiating its heart-cheering
influence over sixteen millions of freemen, revered at home, respected
abroad, and without a rival in the annals of legislation.</p>

<p>Judge Sherman did much to remove the objections made against
this important document by the people of his own and adjoining states.
He showed them clearly, and convinced them fully, that to effect and
perpetuate the union, private feeling and interest must yield to public
policy and public good; and that each state should strive to produce
an equilibrium in the government of the whole. The wisdom of the
sages who framed, and by their continued exertion and salutary influence
effected the adoption of the Constitution of the United States,
deserves our admiration quite as much as when they guided our
nation through the storms of the revolution. It is often easier to
acquire a particular object than to properly enjoy and preserve it.</p>

<p>Judge Sherman was elected a member of the first congress under
the new government, and resigned his judicial station that he might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
take a seat in that body. His influence had great weight in the national
legislature. His exertions to promote the interests of his country
were unremitting. Traces of his magnanimity and prophetic
policy are upon the journals, and in many of the early laws of our
country.</p>

<p>Upon many subjects members differed, and, in some instances, much
warmth and acrimony were exhibited. On such occasions, Mr. Sherman
was peculiarly happy in his exertions to produce reconciliation.
He was emphatically a peace maker.</p>

<p>At the expiration of his representative term, he was elected to the
United States Senate, of which he was a member when he closed his
useful career, and bade a long adieu, a final farewell, to earth and its
toils. He died on the 23d of July, 1793, in the full enjoyment of that religion
he had honoured and practised in all the changing scenes of his
eventful pilgrimage. He had lived the life of a good man, his closing
scene was calm, happy, and serene. He could triumph over death
and the grave, reaching forward to receive the enduring prize of immortal
glory. He could approach the dread tribunal of the great Jehovah,
smiling and smiled upon; and enter into pure and unalloyed
bliss, lasting as the rolling ages of eternity.</p>

<p>Thus closed the valuable and useful life of Roger Sherman. He
had been a faithful public servant nearly forty years. He had participated
in all the trying scenes of the revolution; he had seen his
country burst into being, a nation of freemen. He had aided in effecting
a consolidation of the government; he had seen the dawnings of
prosperity. In all the important measures of the state of his adoption,
and of the American nation, he had taken an active and important
part, from the commencement of the French war to the time of his
death.</p>

<p>As a Christian, he was esteemed by all denominations, for his consistent
piety and liberal charity. With him, sectarianism was not
religion; for him it had no charms. His philanthropy was as broad as
creation; it reached from earth to Heaven. He made himself acquainted
with the abstrusest branches of theology, and was an esteemed
correspondent of several celebrated divines.</p>

<p>In the history of Roger Sherman, we behold one of nature’s fairest
sheets of purest white, covered with all the sublime delineations that
dignify a man, and assimilate him to his Creator. His life was crowned
with unfading laurels, plucked from the rich soil of genuine worth
and substantial merit. No ephemeral flowers decked his venerable
brow. A chaplet of amaranthine roses surmounts his well-earned
fame. The mementos of his examples are a rich boon to posterity, and,
whilst religion and social order survive, the virtues of this great and
good man will shine in all the majesty of light. His private character
was as pure as his public career was illustrious. He buried none
of his talents; he fulfilled the design of his creation.</p>

<p>By his example it is plainly demonstrated, that man is the architect
of his own fortune. By industry and perseverance, with the aid of books,
now accessible to all, young apprentices and mechanics may surmount
the Alpine summit of science, and take their stations, with superior<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
advantages, by the side of those who have become enervated within the
walls of a college. No one in our land of intelligence is excusable
for growing up under the dark shades of ignorance. The sun of
science has risen, and all who will, may bask in its genial rays. The
field of knowledge and path to glory are open to all. The means of
acquiring information are far superior to those enjoyed by Sherman
and Franklin. Let their bright and shining examples be imitated by
Columbia’s sons, and our happy republic will live for centuries. Let
ignorance, corruption, and fanaticism predominate, and the fair fabric
of our freedom, reared by the valour, and cemented by the blood of
the revolutionary patriots, will tremble, totter, and fall. Chaos will
mount the car of discord, sound the dread clarion of death, and
<span class="smcap smaller">LIBERTY</span> will expire amidst the smoking ruins of her own citadel.
Remember that “knowledge is power,” wealth “the sinews of power,”
and that honesty, virtue, and integrity are the regulators of them both.
Remember that intrigue, fanaticism, and faction may prostrate, at one
bold stroke, the fairest, noblest work of years.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_6">EDWARD RUTLEDGE.</h2>
</div>

<p>The thrilling subject of American Independence is ever welcome
to the patriot and philanthropist. The annual celebration of the event
is calculated to perpetuate a kindred feeling and a kindred love of
liberty. The time <em>may</em> arrive when the <em>day</em> may not be celebrated,
but to the end of time the <em>event</em>, and the names of those who achieved
it, will be handed down on the historic page with pride and veneration.
The names of the Signers of the Declaration, like those of the
twelve Apostles, are surrounded by a wreath of glory unfading and
untarnished. Among them we find that of <span class="smcap">Edward Rutledge</span>, who
was born in Charleston, S.&nbsp;C., in November, 1749. His father, Dr.
John Rutledge, was a native of Ireland, who married Sarah Hert, a
lady of high accomplishments, piety and good sense. Edward lost
his father at an early age, and, like those of many great and good
men, his mind was moulded by his mother. After passing through
the usual routine of an education, he commenced the study of law
with an elder brother, who stood high at the Charleston bar. Whilst
he stored his mind with Coke and Bacon, he paid great attention to
elocution. In 1769 he went to England, became a student at the
temple, made himself familiar with the practice of courts, with the
rules of parliament, with the policy, designs and feelings of the British
ministry, and cultivated an acquaintance with the celebrated orators
and statesmen Chatham, Mansfield and others. In 1773, he returned,
richly laden with stock for future use. He commenced a successful
practice, uniting an expressive countenance, a good voice, a rich imagination,
elegance of action, an honourable mind, and a good heart,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
with strong native talent, improved by superior advantages and untiring
industry.</p>

<p>He soon acquired a merited eminence as a bold, discreet and able
advocate. He was peculiarly happy in his exertions excited by the
spur of the moment, a talent always useful to a lawyer, and eminently
useful to a statesman during a revolutionary struggle. His lamp was
always trimmed and burning, and with true Irish zeal and eloquence,
he was always ready to enter the arena where duty called him. He
had a warm heart for the weak and oppressed.</p>

<p>It was self-evident that talents like his were well calculated to
promote the cause of emancipation, and Mr. Rutledge was among the
first selected members to the continental congress in 1774. This
alone was sufficient to place him on the list of imperishable fame; for
none but men of superior merit, known fortitude, and of pure patriotism,
were selected to represent their country’s rights and repel a
monarch’s wrongs. Such a man was Edward Rutledge. With the
ardour of an Emmet, he united great prudence and discretion. By his
open frankness of expression he incurred the displeasure of the crown
adherents, but imparted the holy flame of patriotism to the friends of
liberty in a pre-eminent degree.</p>

<p>With all his ardour and zeal he was a friend to order and opposed
to mobocracy. He acted from enlightened and liberal principles,
aiming to build every superstructure on the firm basis of reason and
justice. To this nobleness of design, conceived and adhered to by
all of the signers of the declaration, may be attributed the lofty
dignity that pervaded that august body. Revolution is a tornado
where prudence seldom enters to neutralize its baneful effects; but
when such men as those who constituted the first American congress
in Philadelphia combine, men who could command the whirlwind of
passion, and conduct the lightning of revenge by the silken cords of
reason, and the steel rods of unbending patriotism to a desired and
useful destination, revolution is stripped of its bane and is crowned
with unfading glory. Such were the signers of the declaration—such
was the American revolution. We find Mr. Rutledge associated with
several important committees of the continental congress, and among
them he was appointed with John Adams and Benjamin Franklin to
meet Lord Howe, when he came clothed with authority to offer humiliating
terms of peace. No three men could have been selected whose
combined talents were better calculated to inspire awe and respect.
They were received and treated with marked attention by his lordship,
who became convinced, that under the direction of such spirits
as these, the rebels would conquer or die. They detested his offers
of pardon, for who had they injured? They disclaimed all right of
the crown to their allegiance; it had been sacrificed at the shrine of
an ambitious ministry. Freedom was their motto—Liberty their
watchword, and their terms <em>Independence or death</em>. They had resolved
“to do or die.”</p>

<p>As a sound, judicious and able statesman, Mr. Rutledge stood high;
his brow was also decked by laurels in the field. He had long commanded
a company in the ancient battalion of artillery. When the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
British landed at Port Royal in 1779, he led his company to the
attack with the skill and courage of a veteran. At no battle during
the revolution was more personal bravery displayed than at this, nor
was the enemy, at any time, more chagrined at a total defeat by raw
militia. It was a mystery to them to find in the same man, the statesman,
the soldier and the hero. He was at a subsequent period elected
colonel. During the investment of Charleston by the enemy in 1780,
he was again in the field, but was unfortunately taken prisoner, sent
to St. Augustine, and not exchanged for nearly a year. Before his
return the dark clouds began to recede, and the horizon of liberty was
slowly illuminated by the rays of hope.</p>

<p>He returned to his native state and aided in restoring the civil
government that had been paralyzed by the cruel conquering arm of
the crown. He was a member of the enraged assembly who met at
Jacksonborough in 1782, and with his recent injuries and those of his
friends bleeding fresh before him, he sanctioned the bill of pains and
penalties, that, under other circumstances, would not have received
his approval, and which, during the time it remained in force, he used
every exertion to meliorate.</p>

<p>Among those who had been tortured by persecution was his venerable
mother, who had been taken from her peaceful home in the country
and confined in Charleston, then occupied by the British; a high
compliment to her talents and patriotism, placing her on the list of
fame with the matrons of Greece and Rome.</p>

<p>During the whole of the doubtful and protracted struggle of the
revolution, Mr. Rutledge remained its steady and zealous advocate,
and gave his best exertions in its behalf. After its termination, he
again returned to the bosom of his friends and the labours of his profession.
His private worth took deep root in the affections of the
community, and he had the confidence and esteem of a large circle of
acquaintances.</p>

<p>In organizing the new government of his native state, he acted a
useful and consistent part. Many difficulties were to be overcome,
many clashing local interests to be reconciled, and many measures
and laws adopted, to restore an equilibrium in private and public concerns.
A great commotion existed between debtors and creditors;
specie was out of the question; the paper currency was nearly annihilated,
and many who felt that they had shaken off the British
yoke, were about to fall into the hands of relentless creditors, who,
when prompted by avarice, are as destitute of mercy as the pirate is
of compassion. Instances are on record in our own country, (I blush
as I write,) where some of those very veterans who bled for our
boasted freedom, have been incarcerated in a prison by the cold
inquisitorial creditor, for sums so trifling that shame would hide its
face to name them.</p>

<p>In this dilemma, Mr. Rutledge was among those who proposed and
passed a law, making property a lawful tender for debts; a law purely
republican, but so obnoxious to avarice, that most men, who are aristocrats
just in proportion to the amount of wealth they acquire above
the wants of life, oppose it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
He also favoured the instalment law, and used his best exertions to
meliorate the condition of the poor as well as the rich, by the enactment
of laws based upon humanity and justice. He took an active
part in most of the legislation of the state, and when the federal constitution
was presented for consideration, he was, taking it as a whole,
its warm and zealous advocate. Purely republican in principle, he
was always opposed to slavery, deeming it a national curse. He was
untiring in his labour—emphatically a working man. Dr. Ramsay
remarks of him, “For the good obtained and the evil prevented, his
memory will be long respected by his countrymen.”</p>

<p>As I have before remarked, he was a friend to order and law, and
when any measure was consummated by legislative action, or by any
public functionary duly authorized to act, he delighted in seeing it
fulfilled to the letter. Although he was in feeling with the French
when difficulties arose between them and England, he reprobated
strongly the conduct of M. Genet and the French Directory. He
was not a party man, but was always actuated by a sense of duty, and
a pure desire for the prosperity of his country. His was the stern,
unflinching moderation, calculated to awe a mob, paralyze a faction,
and preserve, pure and undefiled, that lofty patriotism which commands
esteem and respect.</p>

<p>In 1798 he was elected governor of his native state. Soon after,
disease fastened its relentless hands upon him, and handed him
over to the king of terrors in the mid career of his term. During the
legislative session of 1800, his illness increased so rapidly that he
felt an assurance that his dissolution was rapidly approaching, and
was desirous of returning to Charleston, that he might yield up his
breath where he first inhaled the atmosphere. The constitution required
the presence of the governor during the sitting of the legislature,
and so scrupulous was he to fulfil its letter, that he determined
to remain unless both branches passed a resolution sanctioning his
absence. The subject was submitted, but on some debate arising from
the partisan feeling then prevalent, the application was immediately
withdrawn, and he remained until the legislature adjourned. He was
barely able to reach his home, when he laid down upon the bed of death
and yielded to the only tyrant that could conquer his patriotic spirit,
on the 23d of January, 1800. The same fortitude that had characterized
his whole life, was strongly exhibited during his last illness,
and did not forsake him in his dying hours. His loss was severely
felt and deeply lamented by his mourning fellow-citizens. In the
death of this good man, his native state lost one of its brightest ornaments,
one of its noblest sons.</p>

<p>Governor Rutledge stood high as an orator. He appears to have
understood well the machinery of human nature, and knew well when
to address the <em>judgment</em> and when the <em>passions</em> of his audience. In
exciting the sympathy of a jury, he had no equal at the Charleston
bar. He also knew how, where, and when to be logical; and, what
is all-important in every man, either in the public or private walks of
life, he knew <em>how</em>, <em>when</em>, and <em>where</em> to speak, and <em>what</em> to say. His
private worth and public services were highly honourable to himself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
consoling to his friends and beneficial to his country. His usefulness
only ended with his life; his fame is untarnished with error; his examples
are worthy of imitation, and his life without a blank.</p>

<p>By his first wife, Harriet, daughter of Henry Middleton, one of his
colleagues in congress, he had a son and daughter, the latter of whom
remained in Charleston, the former, Major Henry M. Rutledge, became
one of the pioneers of Tennessee. God grant that he may imitate
the virtues of his venerable father, and fill the blank our country
experienced in the death of the wise, the judicious, the benevolent,
the philanthropic, the patriotic, and the high minded <span class="smcap">Edward Rutledge</span>.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_7">THOMAS M’KEAN.</h2>
</div>

<p>But few men have contributed more to fill the measure of the glory
and prosperity of their country, than the subject of this brief sketch.
He was a native of Chester county, Pennsylvania, and born on the
19th day of March, 1734. He was the son of William M’Kean, who
immigrated from Ireland when quite young. He placed Thomas, at an
early age, under the tuition of the Rev. Francis Allison, then principal
of one of the most celebrated Seminaries of the Province, and a
gentleman of profound science and erudition. The talents of Thomas
soon budded and blossomed like the early rose of spring. His mind
was moulded for close application to study; his proficiency was truly
gratifying to his teachers and friends, and gave high promise of unusual
attainments. He became a thorough linguist, a practical mathematician,
and a moral philosopher. He was a faithful student, and
left the seminary, a finished scholar and an accomplished gentleman,
esteemed and respected by his numerous acquaintances.</p>

<p>He then commenced the study of law under David Kinney, Esquire,
at New Castle, Delaware. He explored the vast field of this science
with astonishing and unusual success, and was admitted to the bar
under the most favourable auspices. He commenced practice at the
same place, and soon acquired a lucrative business and a proud reputation.
He extended his operations into the province of his nativity,
and was admitted in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in 1757.
His strict attention to business and his superior legal acquirements,
obtained for him an extensive and just celebrity. Although he had
become the eloquent advocate and able lawyer, he was still a close
and industrious student. He continued to add to his large stock of
knowledge, with the same avidity and to greater advantage, than when
he commenced his scientific career. He did not fall into the error
that has prevented some lawyers of strong native talent from rising
above mediocrity: <em>that when their practice begins their studies end</em>.
This is a rock on which many have been shipwrecked in all the learned
professions. The laws of nature demand a constant supply of food in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
the intellectual as well as in the physical world. The corroding rust
of forgetfulness will mar the most brilliant acquirements, of literature,
unless kept bright by use; and much study is requisite to keep pace
with the march of mind and the ever varying changes in the field of
science, constantly under the cultivation of the soaring intellect of
man. It maybe said, that the grand basis of the law is as unchanging
as the rock of adamant. To this I answer: its superstructure is an
increasing labyrinth, and, unless the progress of the work is kept constantly
in view, those who enter, strangers to its meanderings, will
find themselves in a perplexing situation.</p>

<p>In 1762, Mr. M’Kean was elected a member of the Delaware assembly
from New Castle county, and was continued in that station
for eleven successive years, when he removed to the city of Philadelphia.
So much attached to him were the people of that county, that
they continued to elect him for six succeeding years after his removal,
although he necessarily declined the honour of serving. He was
claimed by Delaware and Pennsylvania as a favourite son of each,
under the old regimen, and did, in fact, serve both after changing his
residence, by being elected to the continental congress from the state
of Delaware, being then Chief Justice of Pennsylvania, the former
state claiming him, probably, because he still retained his mansion,
furnished by himself, in New Castle, where his business frequently
called him.</p>

<p>In 1779, he attempted to take final leave of his constituents in Delaware,
and on that occasion, as a large meeting was convened for
the purpose, made a most animating, patriotic and thrilling speech;
portraying, in glowing colours, the bright prospects that were dawning
upon the infant republic, and the certainty of being able to maintain
the independence of the United States. After he retired, a committee
waited upon him, with the novel request, that he would name seven
gentlemen, suitable to be elected to the assembly. He desired them
to report his thanks for the confidence they expressed in his judgment,
and assured them there were not only <em>seven</em> but <em>seventy</em> then in the
meeting, fully qualified to represent the people, and begged to be
excused from <em>naming</em> any gentlemen, lest he should give offence. A
second time the committee called and insisted on the selection by him,
with the full assurance that he would give no offence. He then named
seven candidates, and had the gratification to learn that they were
all elected. An unlimited confidence in his abilities and integrity,
was strongly felt by his constituents, he continued to represent them
in congress during the eventful period of the war.</p>

<p>In 1765, he was a member of the Congress of New York, sent from
Delaware. He was one of the committee that drafted the memorable
address to the House of Commons of Great Britain. His patriotism,
love of liberty, and unbending firmness of purpose; were fully demonstrated
in that instrument, as well as in the acts of his subsequent life.
He was a republican to the core, and despised the chains of political
slavery, the baubles of monarchy, and the trappings of a crown. He
was for <span class="smcap smaller">LIBERTY</span> or death, and scorned to be a slave.</p>

<p>On his return, the same year, he was appointed judge of the court<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
of common pleas, quarter sessions, and orphans’ court, of New Castle
county. The stamp act was then in full <em>life</em>, but not in full <em>force</em>:
Judge M’Kean directed the officers of the courts over which he presided
not to use stamped paper, as had been ordered by the hirelings
of the British ministers. He set their authority at utter defiance, and
was the first Judge, in any of the colonies, who took this bold stand.
That circumstance alone, trifling as it may now seem to some readers,
was big with events, and was an important entering wedge to the revolution,
and stamped his name, in bold relievo, on the tablet of enduring
fame. He had talent to design and energy to execute. From
that time forward, in all the leading measures of the struggle for
liberty, he was among the leading patriots.</p>

<p>He was a prominent member of the congress of 1774, that convened
at Philadelphia. From that time to the peace of 1783, he was a member
of the continental congress, and the only one who served during the
whole time. He was a strong advocate for the declaration of independence,
and most willingly affixed his signature to that sacred instrument.
When it came up for final action, so anxious was he that it should
pass <em>unanimously</em>, that he sent an express after Cæsar Rodney, one of
his colleagues, the other, Mr. Read, having manifested a disposition to
vote against it. Mr. Rodney arrived on the 4th of July, just in time
to give his vote in favour of the important measure, and thus secured
its unanimous adoption. Notwithstanding the arduous duties that devolved
on Mr. M’Kean, as member of congress, member of several committees,
and chief justice of Pennsylvania, all of which he discharged
satisfactorily—so ardent was his patriotism, so devoted was he to promote
the cause he had nobly espoused, that he accepted a colonel’s
commission, and was appointed to the command of a regiment of associators,
raised in the city of Philadelphia, and marched to the support
of Gen. Washington, with whom he remained until a supply of new
recruits was raised. During his absence, his Delaware constituents
had elected him a member of the convention to form a constitution.
On his return he proceeded to New Castle, and, in a tavern, without
premeditation or consulting men or books, he hastily penned the constitution
that was adopted by the delegates. Understanding the wants
and feelings of the people, well versed in law and the principles of
republicanism, and a ready writer, he was enabled to perform, in a
few hours, a work that, in modern times, requires the labours of an
expensive assembly for nearly a year. How changed are men and
things since the glorious era of ’76! How different the motives that
now impel to action, and how different the amount of labour performed
in the same time and for the same money. Then all were
anxious to listen! now nearly all are anxious to speak. Then, legislators
loved their country <em>more</em>, and the loaves and fishes <em>less</em>, than at
the present day.</p>

<p>On the 10th of July, 1781, Judge M’Kean was elected president of
congress, which honour he was compelled to decline, because his duties
as chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania would necessarily
require his absence some part of the time during the session.
He was then urged to occupy the chair until the first Monday of November,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
when the court was to commence. To this he assented, and
presided until that time, with great credit to himself and to the satisfaction
of the members of that august body. On his retiring from the
chair, the following resolution was unanimously passed on the 7th of
November, 1781:</p>

<p>“Resolved, That the thanks of congress be given to the Honourable
Thomas M’Kean, late president of congress, in testimony of their
approbation of his conduct in the chair, and in the execution of public
business.”</p>

<p>His duties upon the bench of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania,
which commenced in 1777, were often of the most responsible and
arduous character. He did not recognise the power of the crown, and
held himself amenable, in the discharge of his official functions, only
to his country and his God. An able jurist and an unyielding patriot,
he punished, at the hazard of his own life, all who were brought before
him and convicted of violating the laws of the <em>new</em> dynasty. No
threats could intimidate or influence reach him, when designed to
divert him from the independent discharge of his duty. His profound
legal acquirements, his ardent zeal, his equal justice, his vigorous
energy and his noble patriotism, enabled him to outride every storm,
and calm the raging billows that often surrounded him. He marched
on triumphantly to the goal of <span class="smcap smaller">LIBERTY</span>, and hailed with joy the star
spangled banner, as it waved in grandeur from the lofty spires of the
temple of <span class="smcap smaller">FREEDOM</span>. He beheld, with the eye of a sage, a philosopher,
and a philanthropist, the rising glory of Columbia’s new world. He
viewed, with emotions of pleasing confidence, the American eagle
descend from etherial regions, beyond the altitude of a tyrant’s breath,
and pounce upon the British lion. With increasing vigour and redoubled
fury, the mighty bird continued the awful conflict, until the
king of beasts retreated to his lair, and proclaimed to a gazing and
admiring world, <span class="smcap">America is free</span>!! Angels rejoiced, monarchs trembled,
and patriots shouted aloud—<span class="smcap">Amen</span>!! The grand Rubicon was
passed, the torch of England’s power over the colonies had expired in
its socket, and the birth of a new nation was celebrated by happy
millions, basking beneath the luminous rays and refulgent glories of
<span class="smcap smaller">LIBERTY</span> and <span class="smcap smaller">FREEDOM</span>! The harvest was past, the summer ended,
and our country saved. The mighty work of political regeneration
was accomplished, the independence of the United States acknowledged,
and an honourable peace consummated.</p>

<p>Judge M’Kean, in common with his fellow patriots, heroes and
sages, then sat down under his own fig tree, to enjoy the full fruition
of his long and faithful labours in the cause of equal rights. He continued
to discharge the important duties of chief justice until 1799,
illuminating his judicial path with profound learning, impartial decision,
and sound discretion. His legal opinions, based as they generally
are, upon the firm pillars of equal justice, strict equity, and
correct law; given, as they were, when our form of government
was changing, the laws unsettled, our state constitution but just
formed, and the federal constitution bursting from embryo—are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
monuments of fame, enduring as social order, revered, respected,
and canonized.</p>

<p>He was a member of the convention that formed the constitution of
Pennsylvania adopted in 1790, and exercised an influence in that
body that was of the most salutary kind. In 1799 he was elected
governor of the key-stone state, and contributed largely in adding
new strength and beauty to the grand arch of our union. For nine
successive years he wielded the destinies of the land of Penn, commencing
at a period when the mountain waves of party spirit were
rolling over the United States with a fury before unknown. But
amidst the foaming and conflicting elements, Governor M’Kean stood
at the helm of state, calm as a summer morning, firm as a mountain
of granite, and guided his noble ship through the raging storm, unscathed
and unharmed. His annual messages to the legislature for
elegance and force of language, correct and liberal views of policy,
and a luminous exposition of law and rules of government, stand
unrivalled and unsurpassed. The clamours of his political enemies he
passed by as the idle wind; the suggestions of his friends he scanned
with the most rigid scrutiny. Neither flattery or censure could drive
him from the strong citadel of his own matured judgment. The good
of his country and the glory of the American character, formed the
grand basis of his actions.</p>

<p>The fawning sycophant and the brawling demagogue, he spurned
with contempt. By honest means alone he desired the advancement
of the party that had elevated him. Open and avowed principles, fully
proclaimed and strictly carried out, were by him submitted to the
people, frankly and cordially, without prevarication or disguise. He
was a politician of the old school, when each party had plain and
visible landmarks, distinctive names, and fixed principles. Political
chemists had not then introduced the modern process of amalgamation,
producing a heterogenous mass, that defies the power of analyzation,
scientific arrangement, or classical separation.</p>

<p>Governor M’Kean respected those of his political opponents who
opposed him from an honest difference of opinion, and numbered
among them many personal friends. He was free from that narrow-minded
policy, based upon self, that actuates too many of those of the
present day, who assume the high responsibility of becoming the arbiters
of the minds of their fellow men. His views were expansive
and liberal, broad and charitable. He aimed at distributing equal
justice to all, the rich and poor, the public officer and private citizen.
He was free from that contracted selfishness that prefers present aggrandizement
to future good. To lay deep the foundations of lasting
and increasing prosperity for his own state and for our nation, was
the object of this pure patriot, enlightened statesman, and able jurist.
Her vast resources, her wide spread territory, her majestic rivers, her
silvery lakes, her mineral mountains, her rich valleys, her rolling
uplands, her beautiful prairies, her extensive seaboard, her enterprising
sons and virtuous daughters, were arrayed before his gigantic
mind, and passed him in grand review. He was firmly convinced
that she had only to be wise and good to be great and happy. To<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
this end he embraced every opportunity, both in public and private
life, to inculcate, by precept and example, those great principles of
moral rectitude, inflexible virtue, purity of motive, and nobleness of
action, that alone can permanently preserve a nation. He cast a
withering frown upon vice in all its borrowed and alluring forms, and
exerted his strongest powers to arrest the bold career of crime and
corruption. He was a terror to evil doers, and inspired confidence
in those who did well. His administration was prosperous and enlightened,
and when he closed his public duties, the bitterness of his
political opponents was lost in the admiration of his patriotism, virtue,
impartiality, consistency, and candour.</p>

<p>In 1808 he retired from the ponderous weight of public business,
that he had so long and honourably borne. He had devoted a long
life to the faithful service of his country, and was covered with
laurels of imperishable fame. He stood approved at the bar of his
own conscience, his country, and his God. He had acted well his
part, and had contributed largely in raising the American character
to a proud elevation among the nations of the earth. Thus highly
stood Governor <span class="smcap">M’Kean</span>, when he bid a final adieu, a last farewell to
the public arena, and retired to the peaceful city of Penn, to breathe
his life out sweetly there. He outlived all the animosities that a faithful
minister of the laws unavoidably creates for a time, and on the
24th of June, 1817, at his residence in Philadelphia, resigned his spirit
to Him who gave it, and entered upon the untried scenes of a boundless
eternity, to reap the rich reward of a life well spent.</p>

<p>His private character was beyond reproach, unsullied as the virgin
sheet. His person was tall and erect, his countenance bold, intelligent,
and commanding; his manners urbane, gentlemanly, and affable;
his feelings noble, generous, and humane; and his conduct open,
frank, and republican. He never shrunk from what he deemed duty,
and was always actuated by a desire to promote the interest of the
human family and the general good of mankind. He was a refined
philanthropist, an acute philosopher, an enlightened statesman, an
impartial judge, an able magistrate, and a truly great and good man.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_8">PHILIP LIVINGSTON.</h2>
</div>

<p>Men often engage in transactions and designs, that produce results
in direct opposition to those anticipated. Thus, religious persecution
scattered the primitive Christians into various parts of the earth, and,
instead of annihilating the doctrines of the Cross, they were more
widely spread and diffused through the world. For the enjoyment
of the liberty of conscience, the emigrants to New England left their
native homes; for the same reason, the Huguenots of France fled before
the withering blasts of the revolution of the edict of Nantes in
1685, many of them settling in the city of New York. To the persecuted
and oppressed, America was represented as a land of rest,
and emigrants poured in upon our shores from France, Holland, Germany,
England, Ireland, and Scotland; among whom were many
eminent for piety, intelligence, and liberal principles. To the latter
place, we trace the ancestor of the subject of this brief sketch. The
great grandfather of Philip Livingston was an eminent divine in the
church of Scotland, and, in 1663, emigrated to Rotterdam, a city of
the Netherlands, in South Holland, where he died nine years after.
His son Robert emigrated to America, and obtained a grant for the
manor along the Hudson river, which is remarkable for the beauty of
its location and the richness of its soil.</p>

<p>He had three sons, Philip, the father of the present subject, Robert,
grandfather of Chancellor Livingston, and Gilbert, the grandfather
of the Rev. Dr. John H. Livingston, who stood high as a scholar
and divine. The subject of this memoir was his fourth son, born at
Albany, 15th of January, 1716.</p>

<p>Mr. Livingston was among the few, who, in those days, received
a college education. After his preparatory studies, he entered Yale
College, and graduated in 1737. In common with most of the descendants
of that celebrated family, he was blessed with strong native
talent, which he improved by an excellent education. With principles
firmly based on religion and moral rectitude, he was eminently prepared
to commence a career of usefulness. In those days of republican
simplicity, graduates from college, instead of riding rough shod
over those whose literary advantages were less, believing themselves
forever exonerated from the field, the shop, and the counting-house,
thought it no disparagement to apply themselves to agricultural, mechanical,
and commercial pursuits. Among them, we find Mr.
Livingston extensively and successfully engaged in mercantile business,
in the city of New York. Reposing full confidence in his integrity,
which was then a necessary passport to public favour, his fellow
citizens elected him to the office of Alderman in 1754, in which he
continued during nine successive years, contributing largely to the
peace and prosperity of the city. In 1759, he was a member of the
colonial assembly, which had important duties to perform; Great Britain
being at war with France, which brought the colonists in contact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
with the Canadian French and Indians. Twenty-thousand men were
to be raised by the colonists to guard the frontier settlements, and, if
practicable, to carry the war into the territory of the enemy.</p>

<p>The province of New York furnished 2680 men, and 250,000
pounds, to aid in the proposed object.</p>

<p>Mr. Livingston took an active and judicious part in these deliberations,
and also introduced laws for the advancement of commerce,
agriculture, and various improvements; manifesting a sound judgment
and liberal views. He was an active member of the committee on
foreign relations, who wisely selected the celebrated Edmund Burke,
to represent their interests in the British parliament. From the lucid
communications of Mr. Livingston, that celebrated statesman and
friend to America, was made thoroughly acquainted with the situation,
feelings, and interests of the colonists.</p>

<p>After the dissolution of the general assembly by the decease of
George II., Mr. Livingston was again elected in 1761, a member of
the one under the new dynasty. In 1764, he wrote an answer to the
message of lieutenant-governor Colden, pointing out, in respectful,
but bold and convincing language, the oppressions and infringements
of the British ministry upon the rights of the Americans.</p>

<p>He soon became a nucleus, around which a band of patriots gathered,
and eventually formed a nut too hard to be cracked by all the hammers
of the crown. The consequence of the bold stand taken by many of
the members, in defence of their dear bought privileges, was the sudden
dissolution of the assembly by the governor, whenever he discovered
a majority in favour of liberal principles.</p>

<p>In 1768, the assembly consisted of the brightest luminaries of talent
then in the colony, who elevated Mr. Livingston to the honourable
and distinguished station of Speaker. Discovering that a majority of
the new assembly were unwilling to be slaves and tools, the governor,
Sir Henry Moore, dissolved them, and ordered a new election. He
succeeded in obtaining a majority of creatures like himself, but a sufficient
number of whigs were elected to watch the interests of the
people, and hold the minions of the crown in check and awe. Although
Mr. Livingston, from disgust at the procedure of the governor and his
adherents, had declined being a candidate in the city of New York,
he was returned from the manor, and, on mature deliberation, took
his seat as a member, although opposed, at first unsuccessfully, because
he was not a resident of the district that elected him, in which
predicament a large majority of the members were found involved:
they therefore concluded not to run the risk of having their own glass
houses broken, for the sake of demolishing that of Mr. Livingston.
During this session, he offered a resolution setting forth the grievances
of his countrymen, which gave great umbrage to the adherents of the
crown. This determined them to expel him on the ground at first
assumed, which was effected by a vote of 17 to 6; twenty-one of the
twenty-four members being similarly situated, not residents of the
districts they represented.</p>

<p>A wider field was now opened before him. He was elected to the
first Congress at Philadelphia, and became a brilliant star in that enlightened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
and patriotic body. He was one of the committee that prepared
the spirited address to the British nation, that roused from their
lethargy those whose attention had not been called to the all-important
subjects then in agitation, involving a nation’s rights and a nation’s
wrongs.</p>

<p>He was continued a member of Congress, and, when the grand birthday
of our independence arrived, Mr. Livingston aided in the thrilling
duties of the occasion, invoked the smiles of Heaven upon the new
born infant, and gave the sanction of his name to the magna charta
that secured to it a towering majesty and grandeur before unknown.</p>

<p>He was also a member of the association that recommended and
adopted a non-intercourse with the mother country; president of the
provincial Congress assembled at New York, to devise measures for
their protection, and was one of those who framed the Constitution of
his native State, which was adopted in 1777. Under that he was
chosen a Senator, and attended the first session of the legislature of
the empire State. The same year he was elected to Congress, then in
session at York, Pennsylvania, having retired before their conquering
foe. Deeply afflicted with a hydro-thorax, (dropsy of the chest,) he
felt that his mortal career was fast drawing to a close. It was in the
Spring of 1778, when the dark mantle of gloom and misfortune hung
over the bleeding colonies.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, he was willing to devote his last expiring
breath, as he had much of his estate, to the service of his beloved
country. He addressed a valedictory letter to his friends at Albany,
bade them a last farewell, urged them to remain firm in the cause of
liberty, and trust in God for deliverance; clasped his lovely wife and
children to his bosom, commended them to Heaven for protection, and
looked upon them with a heart full of tenderness for the last time on
this side of eternity. They were then at Kingston, where they had
fled for safety and protection from a brutal soldiery.</p>

<p>On the 5th of May he took his seat in Congress, and, on the 12th
of June, he yielded to the only monarch that could subdue his patriotic
heart—relentless death. He was buried the same day under all the
mournful honours due to his great worth and merit, deeply lamented
by every friend to the American cause. Although he was deprived of
the kind offices of his own family in his last moments, he had a friend
who had been his stay and support in every hour of trial, and now
smoothed the pillow of death. Religion had been his companion through
life; in the hour of dissolution, it was his support; angels waited for
the transit of his immortal soul; Heaven opened wide its gates to let
the patriot in; the king of glory decked him with laurels of bliss; enrolled
his name on the book of life; and crowned him with that peaceful
rest which is the reward of a pure heart and a virtuous life.</p>

<p>His private character was a continued eulogy upon virtue, philanthropy,
benevolence, urbanity, integrity, nobleness, honesty, patriotism,
consistency, and all the leading qualities that render man dignified
on earth, and fit for Heaven.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_9">GEORGE WYTHE.</h2>
</div>

<p>The name of every patriot who aided in gaining the liberty we now
so permanently enjoy, is remembered and repeated with veneration
and respect. A particular regard is felt for those whose names are
enrolled on that bold and noble production, the Declaration of Independence.
Their names, with many others who espoused the cause
of freedom, will glide down the stream of time on the gentle waves of
admiration and gratitude, until merged in the ocean of eternity. This
single act has placed them on the list of immortal fame.</p>

<p>Among them was <span class="smcap">George Wythe</span>, a native of Elizabeth city in
Virginia, born in 1728, of respectable parents. His father was a
thriving farmer, and his mother a woman of unusual worth, talents
and learning. His school education was limited, and, like Washington,
Lafayette, and a large proportion of great men, he was indebted
to his mother for the most of his learning and the early impressions
of noble and correct principles.</p>

<p>From her he acquired the Latin and Greek languages; by her he
was led to the pure fountains of science, and to her he was indebted
for the formation of his youthful mind.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for him death snatched away, nearly at the same
time, both his parents, leaving him still in his minority without a hand
to guide or a voice to warn him against the allurements of pleasure
and the seductions of vice.</p>

<p>His father left him a fortune, which, by prudence and frugality,
was sufficient to render his circumstances easy and comfortable. But
like too many <em>only</em> sons, his father had not inured him to business
habits; he was soon led astray—he was captivated by amusements—and
from that time until the age of thirty, his time was spent in pursuit
of the phantoms of pleasurable diversions, and in idle company,
neglecting both study and business.</p>

<p>Like the prodigal, he then came to himself—returned to the paths
of virtue, studied the profession of the law, was admitted to the bar,
and soon became one of its brightest luminaries—one of its most eminent
members. During the remainder of his life, he pursued the paths
of wisdom most scrupulously, and showed to his friends and the world
that a young man, although led astray by the prowling wolves of vice,
<em>can</em> burst the chains that bind him—redeem his character—correct
his habits—and become a useful and virtuous member of society. So
did George Wythe; go thou and do likewise. He felt most keenly,
regretted most sincerely, but redeemed most nobly the misspent time
of his younger days. If this should chance to meet the eyes of any man
under similar circumstances, let me say to him—imitate the striking
example of George Wythe. Perhaps no man ever maintained the professional
dignity of the bar better than him, or was more highly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
esteemed by his most intimate acquaintances. He was scrupulously
honest, and would never proceed in a case until convinced justice
required his services. If, by any deception, a client induced him to
embark in a suit that he subsequently discovered was unjust, he
refunded his fee, and abandoned his cause.</p>

<p>His virtuous habits, extreme fidelity, judicial acquirements, and
extensive knowledge, gained for him public confidence and esteem.
He was for a long time a member of the House of Burgesses, and
under the new government he received the appointment of Chancellor
of Virginia, which office he filled with honour to himself and usefulness
to his native state until the day of his death. As a legislator he
was highly esteemed for talent, integrity and independence. He was
not the tool of party, he stood upon his own bottom, and depended
upon his own judgment. In 1764, on the 14th of November, he was
appointed a member of the committee to prepare a petition to the
King, a memorial to the House of Lords, and a remonstrance to the
House of Commons on the impropriety and injustice of the proposed
stamp act.</p>

<p>The remonstrance was from the able pen of Mr. Wythe, and was
drawn in language so bold and strong, that it alarmed many of his
colleagues, and underwent considerable modification to divest it of
what they deemed a tincture of treason. He understood and properly
appreciated the true dignity of man, and was not born to succumb
or quail beneath the tyranny of a haughty monarch or an aspiring
ministry. He was a prominent and active member of the House of
Burgesses in 1768, when Virginia blood and Virginia patriotism were
roused, and passed the memorable resolutions asserting their exclusive
right to levy their own taxes; accused ministers and parliament of
violating the British constitution; and denied the right of the crown
to transport and try persons in England for crimes committed in the
colonies.</p>

<p>In passing these resolutions parliamentary rules were dispensed
with—they went through with the onward course of an avalanche, the
members anticipating the proroguing power of the governor, who, on
hearing of their tenor, immediately dissolved the house. But he was
half an hour too late, they had passed their final reading and were
entered upon the records, and beyond his power to veto or expunge.</p>

<p>This step of the governor was unfavourable to the interests of the
crown, and the people proudly and boldly returned all the old <em>patriotic</em>
members to the next session, with several new ones of the same stamp.
During the recess, the love of liberty and liberal principles had increased
in their bosoms, and they had imparted the same sentiments
to their constituents.</p>

<p>Among the new members was Thomas Jefferson, who had been the
pupil of Mr. Wythe—had imbibed his principles, and now stood forth
a bold and prominent champion of liberty and equal rights.</p>

<p>From this time onward Mr. Wythe continued to oppose parliamentary
oppression and vindicate the rights of his country. At the
commencement of the revolutionary movements he joined a volunteer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
corps, shouldered his musket, determined to vindicate in the field the
principles he had inculcated in the legislative hall. But his talents
as a statesman did not permit him to move long in this sphere of
action, and in August, 1775, he was called to take a seat in that congress
which, in less than a year from that time, proclaimed to the
astonished Britons and to the world, the freedom and emancipation
of the colonies, affixed their names to the Declaration of Independence,
resolved that it should prove either the chart of liberty or the
warrant of death—appealing to heaven for the justice of their cause.</p>

<p>In 1776, in November, Messrs. Wythe, Pendleton, and Jefferson
were appointed to revise the laws of Virginia, and although much
other business devolved upon them, they prepared and reported to
the general assembly one hundred and twenty-six bills by the 18th
of June, 1779. The new code commenced the revision at the time
of the revolution in England, and brought it down to the establishment
of the new government. It underwent the revision of Mr.
Wythe, was truly republican, and does great honour to the heads,
hearts and learning of the committee.</p>

<p>In 1777 he was chosen speaker of the House of Delegates; the same
year a judge of the High Court of Chancery, and subsequently, under
a new organization of the judiciary, sole chancellor. A more impartial
judge never graced the bench than George Wythe. Nothing
could induce him to swerve from the strictest rules of justice, and as
a profound jurist and expounder of the law, he stood pre-eminent.
He was elected to the professorship of the law in the college of William
and Mary, where he continued with success until his increasing
duties compelled him to resign. He was one of the members of the
Virginia legislature at the adoption of the Federal Constitution.</p>

<p>He put in full practice his principles of liberty by emancipating
his slaves, and providing them with the means of support. One of
them, who died prematurely, he had not only given a common education,
but had taught him Latin and Greek, determined upon a developement
of African talent.</p>

<p>In his private character Mr. Wythe was amiable, modest, charitable
and humane. He sought to improve the society in which he moved,
and used great exertions to guard young men against the purlieus of
vice. He was industrious, temperate, practically a christian, and
above reproach. He died suddenly from the effects of poison on the
8th of June, 1806, universally esteemed, beloved and regretted. It
is believed the poison was administered by <em>George Wythe Sweny</em>, a
grandson of his sister, who expected to arrive sooner by his death at
the enjoyment of a part of his estate, but which fortunately was prevented
by a codicil made just before his decease. Although the ungrateful
wretch could not be reached by the laws of his country, the
circumstances were so strong against him that he was stamped by the
public mind with the black, the awful, the enduring stigma of a <em>murderer</em>.</p>

<p>Jefferson in delineating the character of the instructor of his youth,
remarks: “No man ever left behind him a character more venerated
than George Wythe. His virtue was of the purest kind; his integrity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
inflexible, and his justice exact; of warm patriotism, and devoted as
he was to liberty and the natural and equal rights of men, he might
be truly called the Cato of his country, without the avarice of a Roman;
for a more disinterested person never lived. Such was <span class="smcap">George
Wythe</span>, the honour of his own and a model of future times.”</p>

<hr />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_10">ABRAHAM CLARK.</h2>
</div>

<p>Many of the most useful men who have at various periods of time
figured upon the great theatre of human affairs, have ascended the
ladder of fame without the aid of a collegiate education. A clear
head, a strong mind, a matured judgment, and a good heart are the
grand requisites to prepare a man for substantial usefulness. Without
these, you pour upon him the classic stream in vain; it is like water
poured upon the sand, it moistens and invigorates for the moment,
then sinks and leaves the surface dry and unproductive. The advantages
of a liberal education I most cheerfully acknowledge; that a
man may become eminently useful without it, is a fact beyond dispute.
To the long list of names conspicuous upon the pages of history
for patriotism, philanthropy and eminent usefulness, and not
recorded on the books of any of the high places of learning, that of
<span class="smcap">Abraham Clark</span> may be justly added.</p>

<p>He was born at Elizabethtown, Essex county, N.J., on the 15th of
February, 1726, of respectable parents. He was the only son of
Thomas Clark, who held the office of Alderman, at that time usually
bestowed upon men of merit and distinction. He was a farmer, a
man of good sense, and instilled into the mind of his son the enduring
principles of moral rectitude that governed his actions and framed
his character in after life. Abraham received what is termed a good
English education, and was designed by his father for the pursuit of
agriculture. Of a slender frame and of a delicate constitution, he
was never able to endure hard labour, but continued to superintend
the business on the farm which his father left him, when not absent on
public duty. He made himself familiar with mathematics, and attended
to the business of surveying and conveyancing. He also made himself
acquainted with the elementary principles of law, and became a
safe counsellor, imparting his legal advice gratuitously, often saving
his friends from entering into the vexatious labyrinth of litigation,
acting the part of a peace maker between the contending parties. He
was called “the poor man’s counsellor,” and did much to allay disputes
and produce harmony in his neighbourhood. He was often
selected as arbitrator in different counties to settle disputed titles of
land. His decisions were uniformly based on correct legal principles
and impartial justice. His knowledge and judgment became so
much respected that he was appointed by the General Assembly to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
settle the claims to undivided commons. He filled the office of sheriff
and was appointed clerk of the assembly, acquitting himself with
ability and credit in both stations. As he became known to the public
his talents were highly appreciated, not because they kindled to a
blaze calculated to excite the huzzas of the multitude, but because
they were surrounded by the halo of pure patriotism, strict justice,
moral worth, and undeviating rectitude.</p>

<p>When the storm of oppression was poured upon his native land by
the mother country, Mr. Clark was among the first who openly contended
for equal rights and liberal principles. Cool, reflecting, and
deliberate, he had the confidence of his fellow citizens, and exercised
over them a wise and salutary influence. His actions flowed from the
pure fountain of a good heart, guided by a clear head and a matured
judgment. The subject of British injustice towards the American
colonies he weighed impartially, and felt most keenly. He was an
active and bold leader in the primary meetings of his native colony,
opposing coolly but firmly, the audacious and unreasonable claims of
the crown. He was a prominent member of the Committee of Safety,
and contributed largely, by precept and example, to the consolidation
of that phalanx of sages and veterans who resolved on liberty or
death. He had a peculiar tact in rousing his fellow citizens to proper
action, always moving within the orbit of reason and sound discretion.</p>

<p>He richly merited and freely received the confidence of the friends
of equal rights. In June, 1776, he was appointed a member of the
Continental Congress, where he nobly sustained the high reputation
he had already acquired for good sense and unalloyed patriotism. To
such men as Mr. Clark the cause of American independence owed
its ultimate success. Revolution is too often the offspring of faction,
and although successful in annihilating the powers assailed, leaves its
ambitious actors to sink in a tenfold corruption. Demagogues may
kindle to a flame the angry passions of the multitude, but it requires
such men as Franklin, Clark, Sherman, Washington, &amp;c., to guide
these streams of mental fire, and conduct them harmless in their
course. Although the American revolution did not originate in faction,
the zeal of many of its able advocates naturally carried them
beyond the safe line prescribed by prudence and wisdom. Upon such
men the salutary influence of Mr. Clark was happily exercised, and
in a manner which gained for him their esteem and conferred lasting
benefits on our common country. To those who have discernment
and skill to guide the ship of state clear from the rocks and shoals of
error, and avoid the breakers of rashness, intrigue and corruption,
although they cannot make a flowery speech that will cost our nation
thousands of dollars,—to such men, I say, we owe our political safety
and existence. These are they who will preserve, to the utmost of
their powers, the silken cords of our union. They are the neutralizers
of the inflammatory gases that proceed from the fiery craniums of
many of our legislators, who are more classical than discreet, more
in the forum than in the committee rooms, more anxious to promote
<em>their party</em> than the <em>glory of our country</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
On the memorable Fourth of July, 1776, Mr. Clark fearlessly enrolled
his name with that patriotic band of sages who pledged “their
lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honours,” to support the bleeding
cause of liberty, and defend their country from tyranny and oppression.
For this strong and important measure he had long been
prepared, from a firm conviction that no reasonable or honourable
terms would be sanctioned by the ambitious and haughty ministry of
Great Britain. He was fully convinced, that chains and fetters
awaited his native land, unless the cords of allegiance were severed
at one bold stroke. He therefore sanctioned the Declaration of Independence
by his vote and signature, and was rewarded by an approving
conscience and the plaudits of his fellow citizens, who elected
him to the national legislature during seven successive years, except
1779, when he was in the state legislature. Having a retentive
memory, and being a practical man, of untiring industry, he was acknowledged
by all to be one of the most useful members of the Continental
Congress. From 1783 to 1788, he was a member of the
legislature of his own state, and so great was his influence that every
act which excited public attention was attributed to him. An act to
regulate the practice of lawyers, curtailing their fees in some measure,
was emphatically called “<em>Clark’s Law</em>.” As a matter of course
those opposed to particular measures emanating from him became
his political enemies.</p>

<p>Mr. Clark was a warm advocate for the Convention that framed
our National Constitution, and was appointed one of its members,
but was prevented from attending by sickness. In 1788, he was again
elected to Congress, but the following year his political enemies succeeded,
for the first time, in defeating him. He was then called to
the important station of commissioner to settle the accounts of his
native state with the general government. At the ensuing election
he was again elected to Congress, of which he remained a member
until his death, which was caused by a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">coup de soleil</i>, (stroke of the
sun,) in the autumn of 1794, closing his career in two hours after the
commencement of the attack, in the 69th year of his age. <span class="smcap">Mr. Clark</span>
was a consistent christian, a pure patriot, and an honest man. He
was a faithful public sentinel, a kind and charitable friend, an honourable
and generous enemy, and died esteemed and regretted by
all who knew him. His character is worthy of the highest encomiums,
his examples of the closest imitation.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_11">FRANCIS LEWIS.</h2>
</div>

<p>The patriots, sages and heroes of the American revolution, were
composed of men from different countries and of various pursuits.
One feeling seems to have pervaded the bosom and influenced the
actions of all—the love of <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>. This mainspring to action was
confined to no business or profession; all classes who loved their
country and hated chains, flew to the rescue. Self-interest, to a
greater extent than is usual, lost its potent charms, and thousands
upon thousands pledged their lives and fortunes to defend their bleeding
country against the merciless attacks and exorbitant demands of
an unyielding and uncompromising foe. No class of men better understood
the injustice of the mother country towards her infant colonies
than those engaged in commerce. Many bold, daring and intelligent
spirits left the counting-house for the field or the legislative
hall. Among them was <span class="smcap">Francis Lewis</span>, who was born at Landaff, in
the shire of Glamorgan, in South Wales, in March, 1713. His father
was an Episcopal clergyman; his mother was the daughter of the Rev.
Dr. Pettingal, of the same religion, who officiated at Caernarvonshire,
in North Wales.</p>

<p>Francis was an only child, and left an orphan at the age of five
years. A maternal aunt named Llawelling, who resided at Caernarven,
became his guardian. She had him early instructed in her native
language, the Cymraeg, which he retained through life. He was
then sent to Scotland to reside with a relative, where he obtained the
ancient and pure Celtic. From there he was transferred to the Westminster
school in London, where he made great proficiency and became
a good classical scholar. He then entered the counting-house
and became familiar with the whole routine of commercial transactions,
which prepared him to pursue his business successfully through
a long, active, and useful life. When he arrived at the age of twenty-one
he inherited a small fortune, which he laid out in merchandise,
and in the spring of 1735 arrived with it at New York. He found his
stock too large for that city, entered into partnership with Edward
Annesley, leaving with him a part of the goods, proceeding himself
with the residue to Philadelphia. At the end of two years he settled
permanently in New York, and married Elizabeth Annesley, the sister
of his partner. To these ancestors, we trace the numerous and respectable
families now residing in the state of New York of the same
name.</p>

<p>The commercial transactions of Mr. Lewis frequently called him
to Europe, the principal ports of which he visited. He also visited
the Shetland and Orkney Islands, and was twice shipwrecked on the
coast of Ireland.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the French war he was the agent for supplying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
the British army with clothing. At the sanguinary attack and
reduction of Oswego by the French troops under General Dieskau,
Mr. Lewis was standing by the side of Colonel Mersey, who had command
of the fort, when he was killed. He became a prisoner and was
held a long time by the Indians, enduring every hardship they could
impose short of death. As a small compensation for his sufferings
and losses the British government, on his return, granted him five
thousand acres of land.</p>

<p>He was among the early and determined opposers to the pretensions
of the crown in their mad career of taxation and oppression. He
was a distinguished and active member of the colonial congress that
assembled at New York in the autumn of 1765, to devise and mature
measures to effectuate a redress of injuries and grievances. They
prepared a petition to the King and House of Commons, and a memorial
to the House of Lords. Their language was respectful, but every
line breathed a firm determination no longer to yield to injury and
insult. The chrysalis of the revolution was formed at that time. The
eruptions of the volcano occasionally subsided, but as the crater again
sent forth the lava of insubordination, its volume increased until the
whole country became inundated by the terrific flood of war, tinged
by the purple current from the veins of thousands.</p>

<p>In 1771, Mr. Lewis visited England and made himself familiar
with the feelings and designs of the British ministry. From that time
forward he was fully convinced that the infant colonies in America
could never enjoy their inalienable rights until they severed the parental
ties that bound them to the mother country. On all proper
occasions he communicated his views to the friends of liberty, and did
much on his return to rouse his fellow citizens to a just sense of impending
danger.</p>

<p>When it was determined to convene the Continental Congress at
Philadelphia, the minds of his friends were fixed upon Mr. Lewis as
a man eminently qualified to represent their interests in that august
body. On the 22nd of April, 1775, he was unanimously elected a
member by the delegates convened for the purpose, and immediately
repaired to the key stone city and entered upon the important duties
assigned him. The following year he was continued in that proud
station, and affixed his name to the chart of American Independence.
His long experience in commercial and other business, united with a
clear head, a patriotic heart, a matured and reflecting mind, richly
stored with general intelligence, rendered him an influential and useful
member of the Continental Congress. As an active and judicious
man on business committees, he stood pre-eminent. As a warm and
zealous advocate of his country’s rights, he stood unrivalled. He
was continued a member of the national legislature until he obtained
leave of absence in April, 1779, except a short interval in 1777.</p>

<p>He suffered much in loss of property, which was wantonly destroyed
by the conquering foe. Not satisfied with this, the British seized
the unprotected wife of Mr. Lewis and placed her in close confinement,
without even a bed on which to repose her delicate frame—without
a change of clothes, almost without food, and exposed to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
unmanly and disgraceful insults of more than barbarian wretches. In
this painful situation she remained for several months, when she was
finally exchanged through the exertions of General Washington, under
the direction of Congress, for a Mrs. Barrow, the wife of a British pay-master.
The consequence of this base imprisonment, was the premature
death of Mrs. Lewis.</p>

<p>At the close of the war, Mr. Lewis was reduced from affluence to
poverty. He had devoted his talents and property in the cause of
liberty, and what was more, the partner of his youth, the mother of
his children, had been sacrificed at the shrine of oppression. Notwithstanding
these misfortunes, the evening of his life was made comfortable
by his enterprising children, and on the 30th day of December,
1803, calm and resigned, he closed his eventful and useful life in
the 90th year of his age. He left a well earned fame that will survive,
unimpaired, the revolutions of time. His private character was
a fair unsullied sheet, as pure and amiable as his public career was
useful and illustrious. As a man of business he stood in the foremost
rank, and was the first merchant who made a shipment of wheat to
Europe, he was indeed a pioneer in the transporting trade. His
examples in private and public life are worthy of imitation, and justly
deserve our high admiration.</p>

<hr />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_12">RICHARD STOCKTON.</h2>
</div>

<p>Among the great variety of characters who signed that master piece
of composition, the Declaration of Independence, were men of the
highest literary attainments, ornamented by the most refined manners,
the strictest virtue, and the noblest patriotism. Amidst these stars,
the man of whom I now write, shone with peculiar lustre and brightness.
He was the son of John Stockton, born in October, 1730, near
Princeton, in New Jersey. His great grandfather, of the same name,
came from England in 1670, purchased near 7000 acres of land within
two miles of Princeton, and, in 1682, effected the first European settlement
made in that part of the State. On this estate, the Stockton
family continued to reside and prosper, until driven off by the British
army under Lord Howe, forming the nucleus to a large circle of the
most worthy and valuable citizens.</p>

<p>Under the instruction of the celebrated principal of the West Nottingham
Academy in Maryland, Rev. Doctor Samuel Finley, the talents
of young Richard budded, blossomed, and unfolded their beauty;
to the great satisfaction of his teacher, and admiration of his parents
and friends. From early youth, he manifested a comprehensive and
powerful mind. From this Seminary, he was transferred to the College
at Newark, where he completed his education, and received the
merited honours of the first annual commencement at Nassau Hall,
in 1748, under its highly talented and pious President, the Rev. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Burr. At the early age of eighteen, he commenced the study of law
under David Ogden, who then stood at the head of his profession in the
province. He applied himself closely to his studies for six years, when
he was admitted as an Attorney, and two years after, advanced to the
grade of Counsellor at Law. He then established himself at his paternal
seat, and soon rose to the highest rank, and stood unrivalled at
the New Jersey bar. His fame as an advocate and counsellor rose,
expanded, and spread; and he was frequently called from his native
state, to manage suits of high importance. In 1763, he was honoured
with the degree of sergeant at law. In 1766, he closed his professional
business, crowned with the fair laurels of his brilliant career,
and richly rewarded for his toil and labours. He committed it to his
brother-in-law, Alias Boudinot, Esq., who was then on the flood tide
of a successful practice.</p>

<p>In June of that year, anxious to further enrich his mind, he embarked
for London, and was safely wafted across the Atlantic, to the great
European metropolis. His fame had been previously spread through
that country, his visit had been anticipated, and he was received by
the high dignitaries of Great Britain with the most flattering and
marked attention. He was presented at the Court of St. James by
one of the cabinet members, and delivered to the King an address from
the trustees of the College of New Jersey, expressive of their joy at
the repeal of the stamp act.</p>

<p>During his stay, he rendered material services to this college, among
which, was his influence inducing Doctor Witherspoon to accept of
its presidential chair, to which he had been elected, and which he had
declined; thus adding another to the list of high minded and talented
patriots, who nobly conceived, boldly prosecuted, and gloriously consummated
the emancipation of the colonies.</p>

<p>During his visit, he communicated freely with the statesmen of
England who were friendly to their brethren in America, and confirmed
them more strongly in their opinions of the impolitic course
pursued by the ministry towards the colonies.</p>

<p>In February following he visited Edinburgh, where he received the
most flattering attentions from those in power, being complimented by
a public dinner and the freedom of the city. On this occasion, he
delivered an eloquent and appropriate speech, fully sustaining his reported
fame, fully answering their fondest and highest anticipations.
His company was courted by the most scientific gentlemen of that seat
of learning, and he was made a welcome and honoured guest at the
tables of every nobleman upon whom he could call.</p>

<p>During his stay in the United Kingdom, he visited Dublin, where
he received the hearty Irish welcome so characteristic of that warm
hearted nation, and every attention that could render his reception
flattering and agreeable. The oppressed situation of that unfortunate
nation, convinced him more strongly of the tyranny of the British
ministry, and the fate that awaited his native country, by yielding to
their imperious and humiliating demands. This visit prepared him
for future action.</p>

<p>Mr. Stockton was astonished to find so few in England who understood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
the situation or character of the colonists in America; and the
English were equally astonished to find so great a man from the
western wilderness. Misapprehension often produces the most fatal
consequences, both to individuals and nations. The comprehensive
mind of this discerning philanthropist readily predicted the result of
this ignorance, and he accordingly embraced every opportunity for dispelling
this dark mist that hung over the land of his ancestors. With
many, he succeeded in opening their eyes to the true and relative situation
of the two countries; but when the powers that stand at the helm
of a nation are wading in corruption, breathing the atmosphere of
tyranny, charged with sordid avarice, thirsting for an extension of
power, delighting in slavery and oppression, they dethrone reason,
bid defiance to justice, trample law under their feet, and, if possible,
would dethrone the great Jehovah to accomplish their designs. Thus
infatuated were the British ministry when they turned a deaf ear to
the petitions and remonstrances of the American colonists, and the
wise counsels of the ablest statesmen that then illuminated their parliament.</p>

<p>Having been more than a year absent from “sweet home,” Mr.
Stockton began to make arrangements for his return. His mind had
become greatly enriched and embellished by the numerous advantages
of his varied intercourse with men of science and eminence. He had
listened to the forensic eloquence and powerful arguments of Blackstone,
and the other celebrated pleaders at Westminster Hall. He
had treasured in his capacious mind, the clear and erudite decisions
of the learned and profound judges, who then graced the judicial bench.
He had witnessed the enrapturing powers of Chatham, and the logical
genius of Burke. He had become familiar with the highly polished
and fascinating manners of Chesterfield, and had seen Garrick in the
zenith of his glory. Thus richly laden, he spread his sails to the
gentle breeze, and, in twenty-six days, he was wafted to the shores of
his native land, where he arrived in September, 1767. He was received
with demonstrations of the liveliest joy by his fellow citizens,
and of the kindest affection by his immediate friends and connections.</p>

<p>Two years after he was elevated to a seat in the supreme judiciary
and executive council, in consequence of the high opinion entertained
of his talents by the King.</p>

<p>In 1774 he was appointed a judge of the supreme court, being
associated with his old friend and preceptor, David Ogden. During
this time he greatly improved and embellished his plantation, and
was surrounded by all the comforts and enjoyments this world can
give. But how uncertain are the joys of this mundane sphere. The
revolutionary storm was gathering. The dark clouds were rolling
on the winds of fury. An awful crisis had arrived. He was a favourite
of the crown. The flames of revenge were concentrating like the
raging fire on a prairie, and it became necessary for him to choose
whom he would serve. The influence he wielded made the decision
one of high importance to his king and his country. In view of the
prospect as presented to human eyes, all that is based on self, urged
him to maintain allegiance to the mother country. But he knew that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
country well. He knew and loved his own better. The pomp of
courts had no charms for him; he was a republican, a patriot, a friend
to liberty; in her cause he enlisted; under her banners he took his
stand, willing to sacrifice his property, kingly favour, and his life,
in defending the sacred rights of his bleeding, his injured fellow
citizens.</p>

<p>He carried with him his friend, the Rev. Dr. Witherspoon, both of
whom were elected, in June, 1776, to the Continental Congress at
Philadelphia, vested with full power to unite in such measures as that
body might deem necessary and expedient to adopt under existing
circumstances. Mr. Stockton, after listening to the arguments several
days, stood forth, an eloquent and bold advocate, for the declaration
of independence, brandishing the amputating knife fearlessly in
public and in private.</p>

<p>Nor did he stand alone. The members of that august body soon
acquired the art of cutting <em>five</em> and <em>six</em>. They forged and finished a
blade, pure as damask steel, and placed it in the hands of their venerable
President, John Hancock. <em>Liberty</em> dipped her golden pen in the
font of <span class="smcap">Freedom</span>, and recorded the names of the memorable fifty-six
upon the shining tablet of enduring fame. At one bold stroke the
cords of parental authority were cut asunder. America was redeemed,
regenerated, and free. Heaven smiled its approbation, angels shouted
their joy, nations gazed with admiring wonder, and every patriot responded
a loud—AMEN.</p>

<p>The extensive information, matured experience, soaring talent, and
powerful eloquence of Mr. Stockton, rendered him one of the most
useful and efficient members of that Congress. His knowledge of
law and political economy, of human nature, human rights, and
of men and things, enabled him to command the respect and admiration
of all his colleagues. He performed every duty assigned him
with zeal, industry, and dignity. In the autumn of 1776, Mr. Stockton
and George Clymer, of Pennsylvania, were sent to inspect the
northern army, with full power to provide for its wants and correct
any abuses that might exist. This duty they discharged in the most
satisfactory manner, both to the officers of the army and to Congress.</p>

<p>Soon after his return he was under the necessity of removing his
family to save them from the brutality of the approaching enemy.
Whilst performing this important duty he was taken prisoner by the
British, dragged from his bed, and, in the most brutal manner, conveyed
to New York, consigned to the common prison, deprived of
every comfort, left twenty-four hours without any provisions, and then
received but a very small and coarse supply; in direct violation of the
laws of nations and humanity, and of all the rules of civilized warfare.
This base treatment impaired his health, and laid the foundation
of disease that terminated in death. His capture was effected
by the information of a tory, who was subsequently indicted and
punished for the act.</p>

<p>This abuse of one of their members, roused the indignation of
Congress. General Washington was directed to send a flag of truce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
to General Howe, and ultimately obtained the release of Mr. Stockton.
Simultaneous with this event, his property was devastated by
a merciless soldiery, his papers and extensive library burnt, and his
plantation left a desolate waste.</p>

<p>Thus oppressed by want and disease, he was unable to again take
his seat in Congress, but was ever ready to give counsel and advice,
and was often consulted. His opinions had great weight, and in this
way his country continued to be benefitted long after disease had
fastened its iron hand upon him. Among his complicated afflictions
he had a cancer upon the neck, which rendered his situation painful
in the extreme. He endured his sufferings with christian fortitude
until the 28th of February, 1781, when death relieved him from his
burden of afflictions, and assigned him a place amongst the peaceful
dead. He died at his native residence, near Princeton, in the 51st
year of his age, mourned, <em>deeply</em> mourned, by all his numerous acquaintances
and by his country.</p>

<p>Thus prematurely ended the brilliant career of one of Columbia’s
noblest sons. He was a man of general science and universal knowledge.
He was the first chief justice of his native state under the new
constitution. As a lawyer he stood pre-eminent; as a judge he was
impartial, sound, and lucid; as a statesman, able, discreet, and wise;
as a patriot, firm, fearless, and devoted; as a gentleman, polished,
urbane, and graceful; as a citizen, liberal, peaceful, and generous;
as a friend, true, sympathetic, and charitable; as a husband, kind,
affectionate, and provident; as a father, faithful, tender, and instructive;
as a christian, open, frank, and consistent; as a man, honest,
noble, and brave; and as a whole, he was an ornament in society, an
honour to his country, and a blessing to mankind.</p>

<hr />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_13">SAMUEL ADAMS.</h2>
</div>

<p>It is a fact worthy of remark, that many of the most eminent
sages of the American revolution were devoted and consistent professors
of christianity, and some of them ministers of the cross. They
all seem to have been actuated by motives pure as Heaven, and influenced
alone by the demands of imperious duty, based upon the inalienable
rights of man. They were not prompted to action from a
love of conquest or of military glory. Their pilgrim fathers fled from
the clanking chains of servile oppression, and planted the standard of
civilization in the new world, that they might enjoy <span class="smcap smaller">FREEDOM</span> in its
native purity, and transmit the rich behest to their offspring. The
principles of rational liberty were enforced upon the minds of each
rising generation, and when tyranny reared its hydra head, they readily
recognised the monster, and resolved, nobly resolved, to drive from
their shores the invading foe.</p>

<p>Among the revolutionary sages who boldly espoused the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
equal rights, was <span class="smcap">Samuel Adams</span>, who was born in Boston, Massachusetts,
on the 22nd of September, 1722. He was a man of middle
size, well formed, with a countenance beaming with intelligence, indicating
firmness of purpose and energy of action. His parents were
highly respectable, and descended from ancestors who had always
moved in the first rank of society, and were among the early emigrants
to this western world. His father was for many years a member
of the Assembly of Massachusetts, and by him, this, his eldest son,
was early taught those liberal principles that he so fearlessly and
triumphantly vindicated during his subsequent career.</p>

<p>When but a child, Samuel Adams exhibited the index of a strong
and enquiring mind, and talents of a high order. Under the guidance
and instruction of Mr. Lovell, an eminent teacher of that day, he was
prepared to enter upon his collegiate studies. He was remarkable for
his close application, and rapid progress in the exploration of the field
of science. He soared above the allurements that too often lead the
juvenile mind astray, and made his books his highest pleasure. His
powers of intellect unfolded their variegated hues like a blooming
amaranth, and shed a pleasing lustre around him, gratifying to his
friends and creditable to himself.</p>

<p>Being of a serious turn, his father placed him in Harvard College,
believing him destined for the gospel ministry. He ascended the hill
of science with a steady and rapid pace, and gained the esteem and
admiration of all around him. During his whole course, he subjected
himself to reproof but once, and that for remaining too late in the
arms of Morpheus, by reason of which he did not arrive in time to
attend morning prayers. At the age of eighteen, he received the degree
of bachelor of arts; and, three years after, that of master of
arts, although much of his time had been devoted to the investigation
of theology, which apparently had been the absorbing topic of his
thoughts during the last years he was in college: the subject of his
discourse, when he took his final degree, showed that other ideas had
also received his attention. It was this: “<em>Is it lawful to resist the supreme
magistrate, if the commonwealth cannot otherwise be preserved.</em>”
In a masterly manner he maintained the affirmative of this
proposition, and with enrapturing eloquence and unanswerable logic,
unfolded the beauties of that liberty for which he subsequently pledged
his life, his fortune and his sacred honour. From that time he
seems to have abandoned the idea of clerical orders, and to have
turned all the powers of his gigantic mind to the disenthralment of
his country. From that time forward he became a bold and constant
advocate of equal rights, and a valiant opposer of British wrongs.
By rigid economy he had saved a sum of money from the stipend allowed
him by his father when in college; this he devoted to the publication
of a pamphlet from his own pen, entitled “The Englishman’s
Rights.” This was one of the entering wedges of the revolution,
and awakened a spirit of enquiry that eventually kindled the flame
of opposition to the increasing oppressions of the crown that consumed
the power of monarchy over Columbia’s soil.</p>

<p>Anxious that his son should embark in some permanent business,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
the father of Samuel Adams obtained for him a situation in the counting-house
of Thomas Cushing, an eminent merchant of that period,
preparatory to his engaging in commercial affairs; but for that sphere
of action nature had not designed him; his mind became absorbed in
the pursuit of political knowledge, international law, and the rights
of man.</p>

<p>About the time he entered the counting-house, he formed a club of
kindred spirits, for the purpose of political discussion and enquiry.
Mr. Adams and some of the other members furnished political essays
for a newspaper called the Independent Advertiser, which were so
severe in their strictures upon the conduct of the creatures of the
crown, that the association obtained the name of the “Whipping Post
Club.” The hirelings of the king treated these essays with derision,
and passed them by as idle wind; upon the great mass of the people
they had a different influence. Stamped upon their face with plain
truth, sound reasoning and uncontroverted facts, they operated upon
British power like the sea-worm upon a vessel, silently and slowly, but
with sure destruction. They contributed largely in perforating each
plank of the proud ship of monarchy, then riding over the American
colonies, until she sank to rise no more. They served as the kindling
material of that blazing fire that ultimately illumined the horizon
of liberty and lighted the pilgrim patriots to the goal of freedom.
“Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth.”</p>

<p>During the administration of Shirley, Mr. Adams wrote several
spirited essays against his course and policy, and portrayed, in glowing
colours, the dangers of concentrating civil and military power in the
same individual.</p>

<p>After remaining for a time with Mr. Cushing, his father furnished
him with a liberal capital, and he commenced business for himself.
By losses, arising from the pernicious credit system, he was soon
stripped of all his stock in trade. By the death of his father he was
left, at the age of twenty-five, to take charge of the paternal estate
and family. In the discharge of that duty, he proved that he was
<em>competent</em> to manage pecuniary matters, by bringing his mind to bear
upon the subject. The estate was considerably involved and under
an attachment when he undertook his trust, from which he entirely
relieved it. This accomplished he again bestowed his attention almost
entirely upon politics. He became celebrated as a keen, sarcastic,
and ready writer, and laid deep the foundations of his fame as a
statesman. He analyzed every point at issue between his own and the
mother country, and exposed the corruptions of the British ministry
to public gaze in all their pristine deformity. He soon became one of
the most popular whigs in his native state, and was hailed as one of
their boldest leaders. From his boyhood he had advocated their cause,
and despised the chains of slavery. So strongly did the whig party
become attached to him, that many of its members who were not personally
acquainted with him contributed liberally to relieve him from
pecuniary embarrassments, which arose from devoting his time exclusively
to political matters. No man had examined more closely, or
understood better, the relative situation of Great Britain and her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
American colonies. He measured every circumstance upon the scale
of reason, and based his every action upon the sure foundation of
immutable justice. He was not rash and inflammatory—always appealing
to the judgment and understanding—endeavouring to allay
rather than excite the passions of men. He was a friend to order,
opposed to sudden bursts of popular fury, and to every thing calculated
to produce riotous and tumultuous proceedings. He took a philosophic
view of the chartered rights guarantied to his country, and
of the infringements upon them.</p>

<p>Organized and systematic opposition against the unwarranted encroachments
of the crown, emanating from the great majority of the
sovereign people, was the plan he proposed; to be manifested first by
petition and remonstrance, and, in the last resort, by an appeal to
arms. Upon the expansive basis of republican principles he took his
stand; calm and undismayed he maintained his position. When the
offensive stamp act was promulged, he exposed its odious features;
and when the climax of oppression was capped by the imposition of
taxes upon various articles of daily consumption, for the support of a
corrupt and corrupting foreign ministry, which denied the right of
representation to the colonies, Samuel Adams proclaimed to his countrymen,
that the time had arrived when forbearance was no longer a
virtue, and that forcible resistance had become their imperious duty.
He showed conclusively that the parliament of Great Britain had violated
the constitution that should have guided their deliberations.
Americans had in vain claimed protection under its banner, its sacred
covering was snatched from over their heads, they were left exposed
to the insults of foreign officers who were throwing the coils of tyranny
around them. To be slaves or freemen was the important question.
Being a member of the general assembly and clerk of the house, he
was enabled to exercise a salutary and extensive influence. With
great ardour and zeal, he united prudence and discretion. From the
time he was elected in 1765, he remained in the assembly of his native
state until he was chosen a member of the Continental Congress.
He exerted the noblest powers of his mind to prepare the people for
the approaching crisis, and kindled a flame of patriotic fire that increased
in volume as time rolled on. He was the first man who proposed
to the people of Massachusetts the non-importation act, the
committees of correspondence, and the congress that assembled at
Philadelphia in 1774. Nor did he confine his exertions or limit his
influence to New England alone; he corresponded with the eminent
patriots of the middle and southern states, and contributed largely in
producing unity of sentiment and concert of action in the glorious
cause of liberty throughout the colonies. Over his own constituents
he held a magic influence. At the sound of his voice the fury of a
Boston mob would instantly cease; he could lead the lion of faction
with a single hair. The people knew well he would maintain what
was clearly right, and submit to nothing, willingly, that was clearly
wrong.</p>

<p>When the affray of the first of March, 1770, between the British
soldiers and some of the citizens of Boston occurred, the influence of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Mr. Adams prevented the further effusion of blood, <em>after</em> the populace
had been roused to vengeance by the death of several of their companions.
He addressed the assembled multitude, and proposed the
appointment of a committee to wait upon Lieutenant Governor
Hutchinson, and request the immediate removal of the soldiers, then
quartered upon the town. The plan was approved, and Mr. Adams
was made the chairman of the committee. His excellency at first
refused the request, but found that fatal results would follow if
he persisted. The chairman met all his objections fearlessly, and
confuted them triumphantly, and told him plainly, that an immediate
compliance with the request of the people would alone prevent the
most disastrous consequences, and that the Lieutenant Governor
would be held responsible for the further waste of human life. The
troops were removed to the castle, and peace restored.</p>

<p>Every exertion was used by the adherents of the crown to induce
Mr. Adams to relinquish his whig principles, and accept of golden
honours under the King. Governor Gage sent a special messenger,
Colonel Fenton, to him, to induce him to bow his knee to the throne.
After finding that England was not rich enough to buy him, he
threatened to have him arrested and sent beyond the seas to be tried
for high treason. He listened with more apparent attention to this
last suggestion, and, after a pause, asked Colonel Fenton if he would
truly deliver his reply to Governor Gage. On receiving an affirmative
assurance, he rose from his chair, and assuming an air of withering
contempt, he said “I trust I have long since made my peace
with the <span class="smcap">King of Kings</span>. No personal consideration shall induce
me to abandon the righteous cause of my country. Tell Governor
Gage, it is the advice of Samuel Adams to him, <em>no longer to exasperate
the feelings of an insulted people</em>.”</p>

<p>This reply roused the ire of the royal governor, and when he subsequently
issued his proclamation, offering a free pardon to such of
the rebels as would return to what <em>he</em> termed their duty, he excepted
Samuel Adams and John Hancock. The two patriots received this
mark of distinction as a high commission from the throne, directing
their future course. They received it as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carte blanche</i>, that left
them as free as mountain air in all their actions. No bribe could
seduce, or threat divert Mr. Adams from the patriotic path he had
marked out. He placed his trust in the Rock of Ages, and enjoyed
the rich consolations of an approving conscience, and the unlimited
confidence and cheering approbation of the friends of equal rights.
These were more dearly prized by him than all the royal honours
within the gift of kings.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams was from that time forward marked out as an object of
vengeance by the British authorities. He was one of the causes that
hastened on the final commencement of open hostilities. The object
of the king’s troops in proceeding to Lexington on the memorable
19th of April, 1775, was to arrest Samuel Adams and John Hancock,
and obtain their papers. Apprised of their business, General Joseph
Warren despatched an express late in the evening to the two patriots,
warning them of the approaching danger. In a few moments after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
they received the information, the British troops entered the house
in which they were, from whom they narrowly escaped. In a few
short hours the dark curtain rose, and the revolutionary tragedy
commenced. The last maternal cord was severed, the great seal of
the original compact was dissolved in blood, and the covenants of
the two parties were fully cancelled.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams remained in the neighbourhood; and the next morning,
as the day dawned, and the sun rose without a cloud to dim its rays,
he remarked to a friend, “this is a glorious day for America.” He
viewed the sacrifice as an earnest of future blessings and ultimate
happiness.</p>

<p>To rouse the people to action, now became the sole business of this
devoted friend of his bleeding country. Having been a member of
the Congress that met at Philadelphia the previous year, he was well
convinced, from the feelings then expressed by the members from all
the colonies, that the simultaneous efforts of those opposed to the
usurpations of the crown, would be exerted in the common cause against
the common enemy. They only waited for the grand signal to action;
this had now been given; the tocsin of war had been sounded; the
requium of battle had been sung; its heart piercing notes were wafted
far and wide on the wings of echo, and were responded to by millions
of patriotic souls, resolved on liberty or death, victory or the
grave. Mr. Adams mourned deeply the death of his friends who
were the martyrs of that tragical, yet glorious day; but rejoiced that
their funeral knell would shake to its very centre the temple of British
power in America, and that their blood would cry to Heaven for
vengeance, and incite to vigorous and triumphant action, the hardy
sons of the new world. The event gave to his own mind new
powers of propulsion, and nerved him with fresh vigour to meet the
fiery trials that were in reserve for him. As dangers increased
he became more bold in his propositions to the people to maintain
their rights; as the wrath of his enemies grew hotter against him, he
became more highly appreciated by the populace, and was uniformly
styled, <em>Samuel Adams the Patriot</em>. His fame and his influence
expanded with each revolving day; his friends were animated by his
counsels and eloquence; his foes were astounded and chagrined at
the boldness of his career. In the assembly of his own state, he
effected the passage of a series of resolutions deemed treasonable by
the royal governor, by locking the door and keeping the key himself
to prevent the proceedings of the house from being known in time
for the adherents of the crown to defeat them. In the Congress of
1776, he was among the first to propose and strongly advocate the
declaration of independence; and always contended it should have
followed immediately after the battle of Lexington. He demonstrated
all his propositions in a clear, calm, dignified and logical manner;
and always planted himself upon the firm basis of reason and justice.
He was extremely zealous, but not rash; he was ardent and decisive,
but wise and judicious. When the Declaration of Rights was adopted
by the Continental Congress, on the 4th of July, 1776, he most
cheerfully affixed his name to that sacred instrument without the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
least hesitation. He had been an able and eloquent advocate of the
measure; he had long cherished and fondly nursed the project of an
unequivocal separation from the mother country, and rejoiced at the
final consummation of his ardent desires.</p>

<p>During the darkest periods of the revolution, he was calm and
cheerful, and did much to banish despair from the minds of the desponding.
In 1777, when Congress was obliged to fly to Lancaster,
and a dismal gloom was spread over the cause of the patriots like
the mantle of night, several of the leading members were convened, in
company with Mr. Adams, and were conversing upon the disasters of
the American arms, and concluded the chance for ultimate success
was desperate. Mr. Adams replied, “If this be <em>our</em> language, it is so
indeed. If <em>we</em> wear long faces, they will become fashionable. Let
us banish such feelings, and show a spirit that will keep alive the
confidence of the people. Better tidings will soon arrive. Our cause
is just and righteous, and we shall never be abandoned by Heaven,
while we show ourselves worthy of its aid and protection.” At that
time there were but twenty-eight members in Congress, and Mr.
Adams remarked, “it was the <em>smallest</em>, but <em>truest</em> Congress they ever
had.”</p>

<p>Shortly after that trying period, the rays of hope dawned upon
them, the news of the surrender of Burgoyne removed the long faces,
and put a new aspect upon the American cause. The friends of liberty
were reanimated; their hearts were enlivened by fresh courage; the
anchor of hope held them more firmly to their moorings. The arrival
of Lord Howe, the Earl of Carlisle, and Mr. Eden, with what <em>they</em>
termed the olive branch of peace from Lord North, also created a
new excitement. Mr. Adams was on the committee appointed to
treat with these messengers of the king. On examining the terms
proposed, the committee found that the pretended olive branch had
been plucked from the Bohon Upas of an overbearing and corrupt
ministry, and promptly replied, through Mr. Adams, “Congress will
attend to no terms of peace that are inconsistent with the honour of
an independent nation.” This answer was as unexpected to the royal
trio, as it was laconic and patriotic. The grand Rubicon had been
passed, the city of chains had been abandoned, and nothing could induce
the sages of ’76 to look back, or tarry on the plain of monarchy.</p>

<p>In 1779, Samuel Adams and John Adams were appointed by the
committee of which they were members, to draft a constitution for the
state of Massachusetts, under the new form of government. They
ably performed the duty assigned them—the convention sanctioned
the document they submitted with but few amendments, and adopted
it for the future government of the state. The same gentlemen also
prepared for the convention an address to the people on that occasion,
which also met the approval of that body, and was responded to, with
high approbation, by the hardy yeomanry of that state.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams was also a member of the convention of his native state,
convened in 1787, to act upon the Constitution of the United States,
then submitted for consideration. Some of its features appeared objectionable
to him, but he cautiously avoided any opposition, lest he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
should endanger its final adoption, which he considered the best policy,
securing for it future amendments. He was most particularly
opposed to the article that rendered the states amenable to the national
courts. After listening to the arguments for and against it, he submitted
certain amendments, which were approved by the convention,
and when it was finally sanctioned by a majority of the members,
these amendments were submitted with it, and recommended for the
future consideration of Congress, and some of them have since been
adopted.</p>

<p>From 1789 to 1794 Mr. Adams was lieutenant-governor of Massachusetts,
and from that time to 1797 was governor of that state. He
performed the executive duties with great ability, and contributed
largely in raising his native domain to a flourishing condition and dignified
standing. He watched over all her interests with a parental
care, and viewed her rising greatness with an honest pride. He had
seen her sons writhing under the lash of oppression, and the bones of
her daughters bleaching in the wind. He now beheld the people independent
and happy, prosperous and virtuous. He could now depart
in peace. His infirmities and age admonished him to retire from
the great theatre of public action, on which he had so long been a prominent
actor, and having filled the gubernatorial chair for three years,
he bid a final farewell to political life, approved by his country, his
conscience and his God. His health continued to decrease gradually
with each returning autumn, and on the 3d of October, 1803, his immortal
spirit left its tenement of clay, and soared aloft, on wings of
faith, to mansions of bliss beyond the skies, where flow rivers of joy
for evermore. He died, rejoicing in the merits of his glorified Redeemer,
who had triumphed over death and the grave. He had fought
the good fight of faith, as well as that of <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>; and felt a full assurance
of receiving a crown of glory at the hands of King Immanuel.</p>

<p>Amidst all the turmoils of political and revolutionary strife, Mr.
Adams never neglected religious duties. When at home, he was
faithful to the family altar, and uniformly attended public worship
when practicable. He was a consistent every-day Christian, free from
bigotry and fanaticism, not subject to sudden contractions and expansions
of mind, rather puritanical in his views, yet charitable in his
feelings, and not disposed to persecute any one for the sake of opinion.
He adorned his profession of Christianity by pure moral conduct, and
the most scrupulous honesty, during his whole life. As a public man
and a private citizen, he was highly esteemed, and richly earned a place
in the front rank of the fathers of the American revolution. He placed
a low value upon riches, and died poor, but not the less esteemed because
of his poverty. He placed a high value upon common school
education, and a <em>proper</em> estimate upon the higher branches of science.
He was strongly in favour of teaching the great mass of the people
the rudiments of an English education, even should it be at the expense
of the classics. General intelligence, widely and thoroughly
disseminated, he considered one of the strongest bulwarks to preserve
the independence of a nation against the innovations of intriguing and
designing men, who regard <em>self</em> more than the glory of their country.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
He took a liberal, expansive, and philosophic view of every subject
he investigated, and formed his conclusions only from a close conviction
that they were based upon correct premises and sound common
sense. In the cause of freedom he laboured incessantly,
from his youth through a long life, and was ever ready to throw himself
in every breach made by the creatures of the crown upon the
rights of his country. At town meetings, in the formation of independent
societies, in the columns of a newspaper, in the assembly of his
own state, and in the national legislature, he always filled a broad
space and moved in a large circumference. He was pure in his motives,
bold in his plans, open and frank in his sentiments, firm in his
purposes, energetic in his actions, and honourable in his course. He
wielded an able pen, varying his style to suit every occasion. But
few of his productions have been preserved. His answer to Thomas
Paine’s writings against Christianity, is perhaps superior to any thing
that has been written on the subject. His four letters on government,
published in 1800, show a clear head, a good heart, and a gigantic
mind. His political essays, penned before and during the revolution,
were soul-stirring appeals, and contributed largely in rousing the
people to a defence of their inalienable rights.</p>

<p>As an orator, he was eloquent, chaste, and logical, always rising
with the magnitude of his subject. It was only on great occasions
that his powers were <em>fully</em> developed; but on <em>all</em> occasions he was
listened to with profound attention. He always spoke sensibly and
to the point, addressing the understanding rather than the passions.</p>

<p>His manners were urbane, plain, and unaffected; his mode of living
frugal and temperate; his attachments strong, sincere, and uniform;
his whole life was one continued chain of usefulness, devoted to the
good of his fellow men, the liberty and prosperity of his country, and
the happiness of the human family. Let his example be imitated, and
our Union may long be preserved from the iron grasp of ambitious
partisans and the fatal snares of designing demagogues: let them be
discarded, and it will prove a rope of sand, the temple of our <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>
will crumble and moulder with the dust of <span class="smcap">Samuel Adams</span>.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_14">DR. BENJAMIN RUSH.</h2>
</div>

<p>A sacred halo surrounds this name, as imperishable as the pages of
history. In the service of his country, and in the pursuit of his profession,
<span class="smcap">Benjamin Rush</span> filled the measure of his glory. His revered
memory is cherished by many surviving friends; his fame will be
chaunted by millions yet unborn.</p>

<p>He was a native of Bristol, Bucks county, Pennsylvania, born on
the 24th of December, 1745. His ancestors immigrated to this country
under the auspices of William Penn, as early as 1683. His father<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
was a highly respectable agriculturalist, and died when this son was
but a child. At the age of nine years, Benjamin was placed under
the tuition of his maternal uncle, the Rev. Dr. Samuel Finley, whose
literary attainments were of a high order, and who was subsequently
elected president of the college at Princeton, New Jersey. Young
Rush continued under the instruction of this accomplished teacher
until he was fourteen, when he entered Princeton college, then under
the direction of President Davis. Like an expanding flower courting
the genial warmth of spring, the talents of this young freshman
rapidly unfolded their rich lustre beneath the shining rays of the sun
of science. So astonishing was his proficiency, that in one year after
he commenced his collegiate course, he received the degree of bachelor
of arts; a high compliment to his former instructor, a merited
tribute to his own industry, acquirements and genius. During his
brief stay at Princeton, he gained the friendship of all around him,
and was esteemed one of the most eloquent public speakers among
the students. With the best wishes of the professors and his classmates,
he left them the following year, and commenced the study of
medicine with Dr. John Redman, then one of the most eminent practitioners
in the city of Penn. The same industry that had marked
his previous course, made him a favourite son of Æsculapius. The
same urbanity and modesty that had made him a welcome guest in
every circle in which he had previously moved, constantly gained for
him new and influential friends. After pursuing his study with
great assiduity for six years under the instruction of Dr. Redman, he
entered the medical university of Edinburgh, in Scotland, where he
reaped the full benefit of the lectures of the celebrated professors
Munro, Cullen, Black and Gregory; and received the degree of
doctor of medicine in 1768. Although then laden with an unusual
store of knowledge in the healing art, his investigating mind led him
to explore still farther the important field of science before him, and
reduce to practice, under the superintendence of able practitioners,
his vast stock of theory. He accordingly went to London, where he
was admitted to practice in the hospitals of that city. He soon
became eminent as a bold and successful operator, a skilful and
judicious physician. After remaining there nearly a year, he visited
Paris, and, in the spring of 1769, returned to the warm embrace
of his connections and friends, and commenced his useful career in
the city of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>His professional fame had preceded him, and his superior acquirements
were immediately called into action. In addition to an extensive
practice, he was elected one of the professors of the medical
school that had recently been organized by Drs. Bond, Kuhn, Morgan
and Shippen. This mark of distinction was conferred upon him
within a few months after his return. Upon a substantial basis he
continued to build an honest and enduring fame, participating in all
the passing events that concerned his country’s good and his country’s
glory; at the same time discharging his professional duties
promptly and faithfully.</p>

<p>Although he had apparently been absorbed in the study of medicine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
it was soon discovered that he had made himself familiar with
the relative situation of the mother country and the American colonies.
He had closely examined the unwarranted pretensions of the
former, and the aggravated grievances of the latter. His noble soul
was touched by the sufferings of oppressed humanity, and warmed
by the patriotic fire of <span class="smcap smaller">FREEDOM</span>. He became a bold and able advocate
in the cause of liberty, a firm and decided opposer of British
tyranny, a strong and energetic supporter of equal rights. Mingling
with all classes through the medium of his profession, his influence
was as extensive and multiform, as it was useful and salutary. The
independence of his country was the desire of his heart; to see her
regenerated and free, was his anxious wish. So conspicuous a part
did he act in the passing scenes of that eventful period, that he was
chosen a member of the Congress of 1776, and sanctioned the declaration
of independence, by affixing his name to that sacred instrument.</p>

<p>The year following, he was appointed physician-general of the
military hospital for the middle department, and rendered himself
extensively useful during the whole of the revolution. He was ever
ready to go where duty called, and exerted his noblest powers in the
glorious cause he had espoused, until he saw the star spangled banner
wave in triumph over his native land, and the incense of <span class="smcap smaller">LIBERTY</span>
ascending to Heaven, in sappharine clouds, from the altar of <span class="smcap smaller">FREEDOM</span>.</p>

<p>This great work accomplished, he desired to be occupied only by
his profession. For a time, his services were diverted from this
channel, by his being elected a member of the convention of Pennsylvania
to take into consideration the adoption of the federal constitution.
Having examined the arguments as they progressed in
the national convention that formed it, he was fully prepared to enter
warmly and fully into the advocacy of that instrument. When it
received the sanction of a majority of the States, the measure of the
political ambition of Dr. Rush was filled. He retired from that kind
of public life, crowned with laurels of immortal fame, that will bloom
and survive, until patriotism shall be lost in anarchy, and the last
vestige of liberty is destroyed by the tornado of faction. The only
station he ever consented to fill under government subsequently was
that of cashier of the United States Mint.</p>

<p>From that period forward, he devoted his time and talents to the
business of his profession, to the improvement of medical science, and
the melioration of the ills that flesh is heir to.</p>

<p>In 1789, he was elected professor of the theory and practice of
physic, as the successor of Dr. Morgan, and in 1791 he was appointed
to the professorship of the institutes of medicine and clinical practice,
and upon the resignation of Dr. Kuhn, in 1806, he was honoured
by the united professorships of the theory and practice of physic and
of clinical medicine, which stations he ably filled until death closed
his useful career.</p>

<p>Besides those already mentioned he performed many duties in various
associations formed for benevolent purposes. He was president
of the American Society for the Abolition of Slavery, vice president of
the Philadelphia Bible Society, president of the Philadelphia Medical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Society, one of the vice presidents of the American Philosophical Society,
and a member of several other philanthropic institutions both in
this country and in Europe. For many years he was one of the physicians
of the Pennsylvania Hospital, and took a deep interest in its
prosperity and welfare. Wherever he could be useful by counsel,
influence, or action, he was sure to be found. To soothe the troubled
bosom heaving with anguish, to alleviate the suffering patient writhing
under pain, to supply the pinching wants of the poor and needy
sinking under adversity, afforded Dr. Rush more pleasure than to
have been placed on the loftiest pinnacle of political fame; a richer
joy than to have been the triumphant chieftain of a conquered world.</p>

<p>Amidst his multifarious duties he arranged his time with so much
system and order as to produce a routine of harmonious action. His
professional duties, his books, and his pen, were all attended to in
proper time. He wrote numerous literary, moral, and philosophical
essays, and several volumes on medical science, among which were
his “Medical Inquiries and Observations,” and a “History of the
Yellow Fever.” He spent much time in the investigation of that
fatal disease, and in endeavouring to arrive at the best mode of treatment.
In this, as well as in many other cases, the lancet was his anchor
of hope. During the prevalence of any disease his exertions to alleviate
distress and arrest its progress, were unremitting and indefatigable.
He obeyed the calls of the poor and needy as promptly as those of the
rich and affluent. He was particularly attentive to those who had
employed him when prosperity cheered their onward course, and were
subsequently prostrated by adversity. He was not a sunshine friend.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He was the man whose liberal mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wished general good to all mankind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, when his friend by fortune’s wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell tumbling headlong to the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could meet him with a warm embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wipe the tears from off his face.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>A pious and exemplary Christian, he poured the balm of consolation
into the wounds of the desponding heart as freely as he administered
to alleviate the pains of the body. His counsels were full of
wisdom and benevolence, and rescued many a frail bark from total
shipwreck. His soul-cheering advice and enlivening presence drove
despair from many an agonized mind, imparting fresh vigour by administering
the elixir of hope and the tonic of perseverance.</p>

<p>Blessed with a vigorous constitution, Dr. Rush was able to discharge
his numerous duties until a short time previous to his death,
which occurred on the 19th of April, 1813. Although advanced in
years new honours continued to gather around him; new fields of
usefulness were constantly opening before him; the lustre of his fame
had scarcely arrived at its high meridian; the zenith of his glory
would unquestionably have reached a loftier summit had his life and
health been spared a few years longer.</p>

<p>As the news of his death spread, a universal sorrow pervaded all
classes; funeral sermons were preached, eulogies pronounced, and
processions formed throughout the United States, as a faint tribute to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
the memory of the departed sage, patriot, scholar, and philanthropist.
When the sad tidings reached England and France, the same demonstrations
of respect were manifested there; the tears of sympathy and
mourning for departed worth stood trembling in many European eyes.
In the halls of science on both sides of the Atlantic, Dr. Rush was
well known, and held in the highest estimation. By our own country
his loss was most keenly felt; by the civilized world, deeply lamented.
The graves of but few men have been moistened by as many
tears from the high and the low, the rich and the poor, as that of Dr.
<span class="smcap">Benjamin Rush</span>. His fame is based upon substantial merit; his name
is engraven in deep and indelible traces upon the hearts of his countrymen;
his reputation is written on the tablet of history in letters of
gold by the finger of justice, dipped in the font of gratitude, and will
endure, unscathed and unimpaired, until the last trump shall proclaim
to the astonished world, <span class="smcap smaller">TIME SHALL BE NO LONGER</span>.</p>

<p>The private character of this great and worthy man, was as unsullied
and pure as his public career was brilliant and useful. His heart
was richly stored with the milk of human kindness; his benevolence
sometimes carried him beyond his professional income in donations
to the poor, to churches, seminaries of learning, and to other objects
calculated to benefit mankind.</p>

<p>He was temperate in his habits, neat in his apparel and person,
social and gentlemanly in his intercourse with society, urbane and
courteous in his manners, interesting and instructive in his conversation,
modest and unassuming in his deportment. He was a warm
and affectionate companion, the widow’s friend, and the orphan’s
father.</p>

<p>In size he was above the middle stature, rather slender, but well
proportioned. His mouth and chin were well formed, his nose aqueline,
his eyes blue and animated, with a high and prominent forehead.
The diameter of his head, from back to front, was unusually great.
His combined features were commanding and prepossessing, his countenance
indicated a powerful and gigantic intellect.</p>

<p>When attacked by the disease which terminated in death, he was
aware that a rapid dissolution awaited him. He was fully prepared
to enter upon the untried scenes of another and a brighter world; he
could look back upon a life, well spent; he had run a noble race, and
was then ready to finish his course, resign his tabernacle of clay to its
mother dust, and his immortal soul to Him who gave it.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_15">OLIVER WOLCOTT.</h2>
</div>

<p>The unqualified and unrestrained oppressions emanating from
crowned heads and exercised with impunity in former times, have
been shorn of half their terrors by modern light and intelligence. As
the genial rays of liberty illuminate the minds of the human family,
thrones will be held by a more slender tenure, and monarchies will
become more limited if not completely annihilated. In Europe,
kingly power has been vibrating for the last century, as if shaken by
an earthquake. The love of freedom has never been extinguished in
the old world; the same feelings that prompted the pilgrim fathers to
tempt the dangers of this western hemisphere, still pervade the bosoms
of millions who are writhing under the goring lash of potent sceptres.</p>

<p>When our forefathers planted themselves upon the shores of America
many of them appear to have understood clearly the principles of
a republican government, as appears from the articles of association
entered into by several and distinct settlements. Among those who
commenced their superstructure upon the foundation of equal rights,
the name of Wolcott stands conspicuous. It is closely associated with
the history of New England for the last two centuries. Henry Wolcott,
the patriarch ancestor of this eminent family, was a native of
England, and settled in Dorchester, Massachusetts, as early as 1630.
In 1636, he, with several others, founded the town of Windsor, in
Connecticut, and established a commonwealth, based on republican
principles, consisting of Windsor, Hartford, and Weathersfield.</p>

<p>The revised constitution of Connecticut is substantially the same
as the one penned by Roger Ludlow, and adopted by this infant
colony; a high compliment to the pilgrim fathers—a proud memorial
of their virtue and intelligence.</p>

<p>During the perils of the Indian wars, during the difficulties with
the Canadian French, and through all the various vicissitudes that
have pervaded New England down to the present time, the descendants
of Henry Wolcott have acted a conspicuous part in the field
and in the legislative hall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver Wolcott</span>, the subject of this brief sketch, was the youngest
son of Roger Wolcott, who was appointed governor of Connecticut in
1751. Oliver was born the 26th of November, 1726, and graduated
at Yale College at the age of twenty-one years. The same year he
was commissioned to command a company which he raised and
marched to the defence of the northern frontier, where he remained
until the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. He then returned, applied himself
to the study of medicine, until he was appointed the first sheriff
of the county of Litchfield, formed in 1751. In 1755 he married
Laura Collins, an amiable and discreet woman of great merit. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
1774 he was appointed counsellor, which station he filled for twelve
successive years. He was also chief judge of the common plea court,
and, for a long time, a judge of the court of probate. As a military
officer he rose from the grade of captain to that of major-general. In
the summer of 1776, he commanded the fourteen regiments raised by
Governor Trumbull to act with the army in New York. He headed
his brigade at the memorable battle that resulted in the capture of
Burgoyne and revived the drooping cause of the bleeding colonies.
He was uniformly consulted on important military movements, and
was listened to with great confidence and respect. From its commencement
he was a zealous and ardent supporter of the revolution.</p>

<p>In 1775 he was appointed by congress a commissioner of Indian
affairs for the northern department, a trust of high importance at that
time. During the same year his influence was happily exerted in reconciling
disputes between the neighbouring colonies relative to their
respective boundaries. Amiable and persuasive in his manners, aided
by a sound discretion and a correct sense of justice, he was well calculated
to be a mediator between contending parties.</p>

<p>In 1776 he took his seat in congress, and remained until he affixed
his signature to that Declaration which burst the chains of slavery,
gave birth to a nation in a day, astonished gazing millions, made the
British king tremble on his throne, and stamped the names of its
signers with a fame that will endure, unimpaired, through the rolling
ages of time.</p>

<p>He then returned and took his station in the field, and on all occasions
proved himself a brave, skilful, and prudent officer. When he
deemed his services more useful in congress, he occasionally took his
seat in that body until 1783.</p>

<p>In 1785 he was associated with Arthur Lee and Richard Butler to
conclude a peace with the Six Nations. The year following he was
elected lieutenant-governor, which station he filled for ten years,
when he was chosen governor, the dignified duties of which station he
performed until death closed his mortal career on the first of December,
1797, in the seventy-first year of his age, regretted by all, and
most by those who knew him best.</p>

<p>In addition to his numerous public services, always performed without
pomp or noise, his private character shone with peculiar lustre.
He possessed all the sterling virtues, was a devout and consistent
Christian, an honourable and honest man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_16">GEORGE READ.</h2>
</div>

<p>When an individual is placed upon the horns of a dilemma, involving
personal liberty, property or safety, his intellectual and physical
powers are at once roused to action. He does not stop to explore
the regions of obtuse metaphysics, speculative philosophy, or of
fastidious etiquette. He flies to first principles, and strains his
reason and understanding to their utmost tension to aid him. He
puts forth his mightiest efforts, his boldest exertions, and his strongest
energies, in order to extricate himself from surrounding difficulties
and impending dangers. In this way he performs astonishing feats,
and surmounts the cloud capt summit of an Alpine barrier, that,
under ordinary circumstances, he would never reach.</p>

<p>The same course is pursued by a nation when placed in a similar
situation. The history of the American revolution demonstrates,
most clearly, the position here laid down. The colonists were placed
upon the piercing points of the horns of an awful dilemma, and were
apparently doomed to slavery or death: yet by their unparalleled
efforts, aided by Heaven, they were ultimately delivered from their
perilous situation, and, although badly gored, survived their wounds.
This was effected by men of strong intellect, clear heads, good hearts,
and sound judgments; men who could reason, plan and execute. The
<em>flowers</em> of literature were not culled for use; plain common sense,
sterling worth, useful and practical knowledge, honesty of purpose,
and persevering energy of action, all based upon pure patriotism and
love of liberty, were the grand requisites to ensure popular favour.</p>

<p>All these were possessed by <span class="smcap">George Read</span>, whose public career I
will briefly trace. He was the eldest son of John Read, a wealthy
and respectable planter, who emigrated from Dublin, Ireland, and
located in Cecil county, Maryland, where George Read was born, in
1734. John Read subsequently removed to Newcastle county,
Delaware, and placed this son in a respectable school at Chester,
Pennsylvania, where he made good proficiency in the first rudiments
of his education. From there he was transferred to the seminary of
the Rev. Dr. Allison, at New London, who was eminently qualified
to mould the young mind for usefulness, by imparting correct principles,
practical knowledge, and general intelligence, fit for every day
use, combined with refined classics and polite literature. Under this
accomplished teacher, Mr. Read completed his education, preparatory
to his professional studies. At the age of seventeen, he commenced
reading law with John Moland Esq., a distinguished member of the
Philadelphia bar. His proficiency was so great that in two years he
was admitted to the practical honours of his profession. He was well
qualified to enter the field of competition, having taken the entire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
charge of the docket of Mr. Moland for some time previous to his
admission.</p>

<p>He commenced business in Newcastle, in 1754, and at once grappled
successfully with the old and experienced counsellors around
him, whose number and talents were neither few nor small. By his
acuteness in pleading, and thorough knowledge of the primary principles
of his profession, he soon gained the esteem of the courts, the
admiration of his senior brethren, the confidence of the community, and
obtained a lucrative practice. His forte consisted not in flowery
show, but in that deep toned and grave forensic eloquence, that informs
the understanding and carries conviction to the mind. He
seldom appealed to the passions of the court or jury, preferring to
stand upon the firm basis of the law and testimony, clearly expounded
and truly exhibited.</p>

<p>On the 13th of April, 1763, he was appointed attorney-general for
the three lower counties of Delaware, and continued in that office
until he was called to the higher duties of legislation. The same
year he led to the hymeneal altar, an amiable, pious, and accomplished
daughter of the Rev. George Ross, of Newcastle: thus adding
largely to the stake he held in the welfare of his country, enhancing
his earthly joys, and giving him an influence and rank in society
never acquired by lonely bachelors. She fully supplied the vacuum
abhorred by nature, and proved a valuable partner of his toils and
perils, his pains and pleasures, through subsequent life.</p>

<p>Mr. Read was a republican to the core, and from the commencement
to the close of the revolution, was a bold and unyielding advocate
of equal rights and liberal principles. When the question of
rights and wrongs became a subject of investigation between the two
countries, he resigned the commission of attorney-general held under
the crown, that he might enter the arena of discussion free and unshackled.
In 1765 he was elected a member of the Assembly of the
state of Delaware, and was instrumental in laying deep the foundations
of the superstructure of liberty. He was prudent, calm, and
discreet in all his actions; but firm, bold and resolute. He was a
member of the Committee of the Delaware Assembly that so ably addressed
the king upon the subject of grievances and redress. He
was in favour of exhausting the magazine of petition and remonstrance,
and if to no purpose, then to replenish with powder and ball.
He did not, nor did any of the signers of the declaration, at the commencement
of British oppression, contemplate a dissolution of the
ties that bound the colonies to the mother country. But he understood
well the rights secured to them by magna charta and the
constitution of Great Britain; and he knew that those rights were
trampled upon by the hirelings of the crown. To vindicate them he
was firmly resolved. He opposed the principle of taxation without
representation, and of raising a revenue in America to pamper royalty
in England. He knew and weighed well the superior physical powers
of his opposers; but he believed the majesty of eternal justice and
the kind aid of Heaven, would sustain the patriots in their glorious
cause. Nor did he reckon in vain. His written appeal to his constituents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
of the 17th of August, 1769, calling upon them to resist the
encroachments of tyranny, was couched in bold and forcible language,
portraying, in colours deep and strong, their rights and their
wrongs, making the path of duty plain before them.</p>

<p>He sanctioned the various non-importation resolutions, passed by his
own and other colonies; the first prominent mode adopted to thwart the
designs and impositions of the British ministry after finding that
petitions and remonstrances were treated with contumely. He was
chairman of the committee of the Delaware patriots, appointed for the
purpose of carrying these resolutions into effect. He was also chairman
of the committee of twelve, appointed by the people of Newcastle,
on the 29th of June, 1774, to obtain subscriptions for the
Boston sufferers, who were writhing under the lash of the infamous
port bill, passed by parliament, for the purpose of properly chastising
the refractory inhabitants of that patriotic city. In February following,
he remitted to the Boston committee, nine hundred dollars,
money received from his constituents, which was eloquently acknowledged
by Samuel Adams, who was one of his faithful correspondents.</p>

<p>Mr. Read was a member of the congress of 1774, and retained that
elevated station during the revolution. He was also president of the
convention that formed the first constitution of Delaware in 1776, and
a member of her assembly constantly for twelve successive years,
after his first election. A part of this time he was also vice president
of his state, and in the autumn of 1777, when president M’Kinley fell
into the hands of the enemy, Mr. Read was called from congress to
perform the more arduous, because undivided duties of a chief magistrate.
On his way home with his family, he was compelled to pass
through Jersey, and in crossing the Delaware from Salem, his boat
was discovered by the British fleet then lying just below. An armed
barge was sent in pursuit. Mr. Read’s boat stuck fast in the mud,
and was soon come up to. By effacing the marks upon his baggage
during a few brief moments before he was boarded, and having with
him his wife and children, he convinced those from the fleet that he
was a country gentleman on his way to his farm, and solicited their
assistance to put him and his family on shore. They promptly afforded
their aid, took his boat out of the mud, and landed him and
his precious charge safety on the Delaware side of the river. The perfect
calmness of himself and lady, and their open frankness, saved
them from the horrors of a prison ship, and probably him from an exhibition
upon the yard arm of a man-of-war.</p>

<p>His duties now assumed an onerous character. Internal dissentions
among his own people were to be reconciled; an intercourse by
many of the inhabitants with the British fleet was to be broken up;
ways and means for his own and the general government claimed his
attention; his mind was burdened by an extreme anxiety to procure
the exchange of the president; and a conquering foe was triumphing
in victory in almost every direction. In the midst of all these perils,
he stood firmly at the helm and rode out every storm. He proved
equal to every emergency, and added new lustre to his growing fame.
When the Declaration of Independence was under discussion, he believed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
the measure premature; but when it was adopted, he most
cheerfully enrolled his name with his colleagues. In 1779 ill health
compelled him to withdraw from public life for a year, when he again
resumed his legislative duties. In 1782 he was appointed by congress
a judge of appeals in the court of admiralty. In 1785 he was one of
the commissioners to settle the boundary line between New York and
Massachusetts. The next year he was a delegate of the convention of
the states, convened at Annapolis, for the purpose of regulating the
commerce of the union. In 1787 he was one of that talented convention
that framed the federal constitution. He was a United States
senator of the first congress under that constitution, and served six
years. He was also chief justice of Delaware from 1793 to the time
of his death. In the performance of all these responsible and multiform
duties, he acquitted himself nobly, and did honour to his character,
his country, and the cause of rational liberty. As a civilian, a
statesman, a magistrate, a patriot, a philanthropist, a gentleman, a
husband, a father, a private citizen, and a public benefactor, <span class="smcap">George
Read</span> was a model worthy of imitation. He was scrupulously honest
and rigidly just. When he arrived at his majority, he assigned his
portion of the paternal estate to his brothers, deeming the expenses of
his education equivalent to his equitable share. He was opposed to
chaos in the smallest concerns of life, and abhorred vice of every kind.
He enjoyed good health in his old age, until the autumn of 1798, when,
after a sudden and short illness, he closed his eyes on terrestrial
scenes, and resigned his spirit into the hands of the wise Disposer of
all events.</p>

<p>The person of Mr. Read was above the middle size, well formed,
with a commanding and agreeable deportment. He was a talented,
virtuous, and amiable man.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_17">THOMAS HEYWARD.</h2>
</div>

<p>To understand, and estimate correctly, the magnitude and design
of his creation, man must become familiar with the thousand
springs and qualities of the undying spirit within him. The labyrinthian
mazes of the immortal mind must be explored, and traced
from earth to native Heaven. The depths of human nature must be
sounded, and its channels clearly marked.</p>

<p>Upon the axis of reason, revolving thought performs its endless
circuit with mathematical precision, guided by the centripetal force
of a sound judgment, or it is projected from its proper orbit by the
centrifugal momentum of random folly into the regions of senseless
vacuity, or of wild and visionary sophistry. Its ceaseless motion is
as perpetual as the purple stream of our arteries; its rapid flight is
bounded only by eternity. It travels through space with more celerity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
than lightning; its earthly career can be arrested only by the hand
of death.</p>

<p>To reflect, to investigate, to reason, and to analyze, is the province
of our intellectual functions. To comprehend the grand and harmonious
organic structure of nature, the wisdom of the great Architect
of universal worlds, and the relation man bears to man, is to learn that
human beings are endowed with equal and inherent rights, and that
they are in duty bound to maintain them. Justice marks out the
golden path, reason leads the way, and patriotism impels to action.</p>

<p>The man whose mind is cast in the mould of wisdom by the mighty
hand of his Creator, if he brings into proper exercise the combined
powers of intellectual and physical force, can never be made a willing
slave. As his soul is expanded by the genial rays of intelligence, he
duly appreciates his native dignity, becomes enraptured with the glories
of liberty, and resolves to be free. If he is groaning under the
oppressions of tyranny and wears the galling chains of servility, as
light shines upon him he will be roused to a mighty effort to burst the
ignominious thongs that bind him, assert his inalienable rights, and
assume his legitimate station in the scale of being.</p>

<p>Thus acted the patriots of the American revolution—thus acted
<span class="smcap">Thomas Heyward</span>, the subject of this brief sketch. He was the eldest
son of Col. Daniel Heyward, a wealthy and highly respected planter,
and was born in the parish of St. Luke, South Carolina, in 1746. His
opportunities for obtaining a liberal education were freely afforded by
his father, and were faithfully improved by the son. He became
ardently attached to the Greek and Roman classics, and dwelt with
rapture upon the history of republican freedom. The principles of
rational liberty became deeply rooted in his mind at an early age, and
when manhood dawned upon him they were thoroughly matured.</p>

<p>After completing his elemental education he commenced the study
of law with Mr. Parsons, who stood high as a member of the bar.
The proficiency of Mr. Heyward in that intricate science was creditable
to himself and gratifying to his numerous friends. He possessed
an investigating and analyzing mind, and never passed over a subject
superficially. He was a close student, and explored the opening
fields of civil and common law with a zeal and rapidity seldom known.
When he became familiar with the principles laid down by Sir William
Blackstone, and understood fully the rights secured to persons
and property by Magna Charta and the British constitution, and compared
them with the iron rod of restrictions held over the colonists by
the mother country, he was roused to a just indignation.</p>

<p>After having completed his course with Mr. Parsons, he repaired
to England, and entered the middle temple, where he became a finished
lawyer and an accomplished gentleman. Although amply supplied
with money, he was not led astray by the allurements of fascinating
pleasures, that first flatter and please, then ruin and destroy.
To enrich his mind with science and useful knowledge, was the ultimatum
of his soul.</p>

<p>He mingled with what was termed refined society in London, which
formed a striking contrast with the republican simplicity of that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
the same grade in his own country. The fastidious hauteur of English
etiquette was far from being congenial to his mind, and did not
accord with his ideas of social life. He there met claims of superiority
over native Americans that he knew were based alone upon pride
and ignorance. His feelings were often wounded by indignities cast
upon the colonial character. All these things combined to rivet his
affections more strongly upon the land of his birth. They operated
as fuel for the livid flame of patriotism, already glowing in his bosom.
The pomp of royalty and the splendour of kingly courts had no
charms for him. The awful distance between the haughty prince
and the honest peasant, the towering throne and the worthy yeomanry,
operated upon his mind like a talisman, and gave his soul a new
impetus towards the goal of equal rights. The more he saw of practical
monarchy, often the automaton of corrupt and corrupting advisers,
the more he became opposed to its potent sway.</p>

<p>After closing his course in the law temple, he made the tour of Europe,
and then returned to the warm embrace of his relatives and
friends, richly laden with the treasures of classic science and useful
knowledge. He had become familiar with the theories of European
governments, and had seen their principles practically demonstrated.
He understood well the feelings and policy of the mother country relative
to her American colonies. He had witnessed her political artificers
at the forge of despotism, preparing chains for his beloved country.
He had seen her coffers yawning wide, to receive the ill gotten
treasures, wrested from his fellow citizens by hireling tax gatherers,
in violation of chartered rights, legal justice, and the claims of mercy.
His own estate had been laid under contribution to swell the unholy
fund. His neighbours around him were groaning under the lash of
British oppression. To enlighten their minds, and make them understand
fully their danger, their interest, and their duty, became the
business of this zealous patriot. Possessed of a bold and fearless
mind, directed by a clear head, an honest heart, a sound judgment,
and a rich fund of useful intelligence, his exertions were crowned
with glorious success. His salutary influence was extensively felt—his
sterling worth was duly appreciated. He was a member of the
first assembly of South Carolina that set British power at defiance,
and was also a member of the council of safety. He discharged his
duties with firmness, prudence, and zeal. No fugitive fear disturbed
his mind, no threatened vengeance moved his purposes. His eyes
were fixed on the temple of freedom, his soul was insulated by the
fluid of patriotism, his heart was resolved on liberty or death. His
life, his property, and his sacred honour, were pledged in the noble
cause. He was elected to the Continental Congress in 1775, but at
first declined serving, in consequence of his young age. A large delegation
of citizens subsequently waited upon him, and, at their
urgent request, he took his seat in that august assembly of sages
in 1776, and became a warm advocate for that memorable instrument,
that proclaimed the birth of our nation to an astonished world, and
shed fresh lustre on the intellect of man. His voice and his signature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
sanctioned its adoption—his conscience, his country, and his God,
approved the act.</p>

<p>In two years after he was called to perform more painful duties.
He was appointed a judge of the civil and criminal courts of his native
state, under the new order of things. Several persons were arraigned
before him, charged with a treasonable correspondence with
the enemy—they were found guilty, and condemned to be hung in
sight of the British lines at Charleston. With feelings of humanity,
but with the firmness of a Roman, he performed his duty, and pronounced
upon them the penalty of the law.</p>

<p>Judge <span class="smcap">Heyward</span> also participated in the military perils of “the
times that tried men’s souls.” He commanded a company of artillery
at the battle of Beaufort, and was severely wounded. At the attack
upon Savannah he was also actively engaged. At the siege of
Charleston he commanded a battalion, and was one of the unfortunate
prisoners who were transferred to St. Augustine. During his absence
his property was pillaged, and his amiable and accomplished wife,
the daughter of Mr. Matthews, whom he had married in 1773, was
laid in the grave. The tidings of these heart-rending afflictions did
not reach him until he was exchanged and returned to Philadelphia.
With the calm and dignified fortitude of a christian, a philosopher,
and a hero, he met the shafts of afflictive fate. He mourned deeply,
but submissively, the premature exit of the companion of his bosom.
His physical sufferings and loss of property he freely offered at the
altar of liberty, without a murmur or a sigh.</p>

<p>He again resumed his judicial duties upon the bench, and discharged
them ably and faithfully until 1798. He was an influential
member of the convention that framed the Constitution of South Carolina
in 1790. Old age and infirmity finally admonished him that
his mission on earth was fast drawing to a close, and he retired from
the public arena, covered with epic and civic honours, lasting as the
pages of history. In the full fruition of a nation’s gratitude and of a
nation’s freedom he spent his last years, and in March, 1809, went
to his final rest, leaving his second wife, Miss E. Savage, and his children,
to mourn the loss of a kind husband and tender father; and his
country to regret the loss of a devoted patriot, an able judge, and an
honest man.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_18">ROBERT MORRIS.</h2>
</div>

<p>Men, whose motives inducing them to action are free from self,
aiming exclusively at public good, are like angels’ visits, few and far
between. Perhaps no era recorded on the pages of ancient or modern
history, presents as many examples of disinterested patriotism as that
of the American revolution. The sages who conceived, planned, and
consummated the declaration of our independence, pledged their
<span class="smcap smaller">LIVES, THEIR FORTUNES, AND THEIR SACRED HONOURS</span>, to carry out the
principles promulgated by that sacred instrument. Never did men
perform their vows more faithfully; never did men redeem their pledges
more nobly. Many of them not only placed all their available means
in the public treasury, but extended their private credit to its utmost
tension, to obtain supplies for the infant Republic, then bursting from
embryo.—No one rendered more efficient pecuniary aid in the advancement
of the cause of equal rights and American liberty than
<span class="smcap">Robert Morris</span>. He was an Englishman by birth, born at Liverpool,
Lancashire, England, on the 20th day of January, 1734. His father
was a respectable merchant, and immigrated to this country in 1746,
and settled at Oxford, on the eastern shore of Maryland. He then sent
for his son, whom he had left behind, who arrived when he was thirteen
years of age. He received a good commercial education, but not classical.</p>

<p>At the age of fifteen, he was deprived of his father by death. He
had previously entered the counting-house of Charles Willing, then
one of the most thorough and enterprising merchants of the city of
Philadelphia. After having acquired a knowledge of commercial
concerns, Mr. Willing established him in business, and remained his
constant friend and adviser. For several years he prospered alone,
but finding the cares of time pressing upon him, he concluded to take
a partner, to aid him in the journey of life. That partner was the
amiable and accomplished Mary, daughter of Col. White, and sister
to the late venerable and learned Bishop White of Philadelphia. She
possessed every quality calculated to adorn her sex and render connubial
felicity complete; and withal, was rich—a desideratum with
some, but a miserable substitute for genuine esteem, sincere affection
and true friendship. No man or woman, with a clear head, a good
heart, and sound discretion ever married for the sake of riches alone.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Can gold buy <span class="smcap">Friendship</span>? Impudence of hope!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well mere man an angel might beget.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Fortunately for Mr. Morris and his partner, their highest treasure
was mutual affection, flowing from the pure fountain of their kindred
hearts, anxious to promote the reciprocal happiness of each other, and
the felicity of all around them.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred to mar their prosperity until the revolutionary
storm burst upon the colonies. Had self interest been consulted so
far as pecuniary matters were concerned, Mr. Morris would have
adhered to the crown. His interests, in point of property, were entirely
commercial: and, in case of an opposition by him to the mother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
country, his wealth was very much exposed. But he had inhaled the
atmosphere of freedom; his soul was fired with patriotism; he resolved
to pledge his <span class="smcap smaller">ALL</span> in the cause of liberty. His influence was extensive;
he was a cool, reflecting and high minded man, and arrived at conclusions
only from mature deliberation. This being his character, his
examples had great weight.</p>

<p>He was elected a member of the congress of 1774, and took a
decided stand against British oppression. Being an able financier,
he was looked up to as the most efficient manager of monetary matters,
and, so far as providing ways and means were concerned, he was
authorized to act. Most nobly did he acquit himself in the performance
of this important trust. As no office of finance was then created,
unfortunately for his country, he could not control the disbursements,
but continued to provide money, often from his own resources. When
Congress adjourned from Philadelphia to Baltimore on the approach
of the conquering British army in 1776, after the declaration of independence,
then called by many the death warrant of the signers,
Robert Morris, who had affixed his name to that bold instrument,
remained at the former city some time after his colleagues left, periling
his personal safety in order to make arrangements to raise funds for
the prosecution of the glorious cause he had espoused. During his
stay, it became necessary that congress should raise a specific sum
in specie for the use of the American army. Information was immediately
communicated to Mr. Morris of the imperious wants of the
commander-in-chief. Not a solitary dollar was in the government
treasury. In a few hours after he received the intelligence, he met
a member of the society of Friends whose confidence he possessed,
who enquired of him “what news?” “The news is,” replied Mr.
Morris, “that I am in immediate want of —— dollars of hard money,
and that you are the man to obtain it for me. Your security is to be
my note of hand and my honour.” The reply was as laconic as the
appeal: “Robert thou shalt have it.” The money was promptly
forwarded to the commander-in-chief and placed at his disposal, and
enabled Washington to meet the enemy at Trenton with signal success.</p>

<p>Mr. Morris made no parade or vain show in the performance of his
duties, and often furnished funds through agents under the injunction
of secrecy, who, at the time, had the credit of affording relief on their
own account. One instance will suffice for an example.</p>

<p>When General Green took the command of the troops in South
Carolina, their destitute situation was deplorable. They were only
partially covered with tattered garments; their food was of the
coarsest kind, and but a scanty supply of that; their quantity of ammunition
was small, and nothing but certain destruction seemed to
hover around them. At that alarming crisis, Mr. Hall, of that state,
advanced the necessary funds to supply the immediate wants of the
army, and enable General Green to commence vigorous operations.</p>

<p>After the war had closed, and an account of the disbursements was
exhibited, it was found that Mr. Hall had acted under the direction
of Robert Morris, who had furnished the needful at the very time it
was necessary to save the southern army from dissolution. General
Green, on being made acquainted with the fact on his final settlement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
at the office of finance, was at first displeased with the measure, but
upon reflection, greatly applauded and admired the wisdom of this
secrecy, “because,” said he, “if I had known that I might have drawn
upon Robert Morris, I should have demanded larger sums, and effected
no more than was accomplished with the means placed in my hands.”
The advances of Mr. Morris to the southern army were near accomplishing
his pecuniary ruin.</p>

<p>As a financier his genius was of the most prolific kind. When he
found one resource after another exhausted; the American troops
writhing under the keenest privations; the credit of the infant Republic
paralyzed, and her treasury drained of the last dollar, had his mind
been cast in an ordinary mould, he must have fainted by the way.
But amidst the embarrassments that surrounded him, he stood calm
and undismayed upon the firm basis of his own resources. When he
found that they were becoming crippled, he submitted to congress
the plan of chartering the Bank of North America, which, after much
discussion, was approved and adopted on the 7th of January, 1782.</p>

<p>The year preceding, the office of finance had been established, and
Mr. Morris appointed financier. Previous to that, it appears he had
not, at any time, been the disbursing agent of the public monies; and
that no system had been adopted by Congress that gave any one individual
the control, under them, of this important department. The
consequence was, that the monies raised for the supplies of the army
often fell into the hands of irresponsible agents and never reached
their pristine destination.</p>

<p>After Mr. Morris was placed in authority over this vital branch of
government, he reduced the expenditures for military operations from
eighteen millions of dollars a year, to about five millions; and thus
enabled the continental congress to prosecute the war successfully,
when, without this retrenchment, its means would have been inadequate
to meet the increasing demands, and the cause of liberty,
to all human appearance, must have been abandoned. Like a Roman
Curtius, he pledged his own fortune to save his country, and disenthral
her from the chains of tyranny. To demonstrate this, I will
mention one of the many instances of supplies being obtained upon his
private credit.</p>

<p>When the expedition was planned by Washington against Cornwallis
at Yorktown, the government treasury was empty, and her
credit shivering in the wind. The army was in a destitute situation:
the means of prosecuting a siege were to be provided, and Mr. Morris
informed the commander-in-chief that unless he arrived at the conclusion
that the necessary supplies could be raised on his (Mr. Morris,)
credit, the expedition must fail. Washington expressed his entire
confidence in the ability of the financier, and immediately took up the
line of march.</p>

<p>In the short space of four weeks, Mr. Morris, aided by the patriotic
Richard Peters, furnished near eighty pieces of battering cannon
and one hundred pieces of field artillery, and all other necessary
supplies not furnished from other sources, and became personally responsible
to the amount of <span class="smcap smaller">ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS</span>,
upon his own notes, which were promptly paid at maturity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
This, united with aid from Virginia and some of the other states, enabled
the American army to give the finishing stroke to the revolution,
and triumph, in victory complete, over a proud and merciless foe.</p>

<p>Under cover of the firm of Willing, Morris &amp; Co., of which our
financier was a partner, many important and advantageous transactions
were made for government, but ostensibly, at the time, for
the firm. Being accomplished in this manner, a great saving was
secured for the public, in the profits of which the firm did not participate
one dollar, as was conclusively shown by an investigation instituted
by Mr. Laurens, in Congress, at the instance of Mr. Morris,
in order to repel the base slanders that were circulated against this
pure and honest patriot. All the accusations that have been brought
against Robert Morris, before and since his death, charging him with
peculation or speculation in government funds, or of any improper
conduct towards his country as a public agent, I pronounce to be
<em>basely false</em>; they have no foundation in truth or in fact. Judging
from the numerous documents that I have carefully examined, Robert
Morris was not only one of the most disinterested patriots of the American
revolution, but was one of the most substantial instruments in
consummating that glorious enterprise. He was so considered by the
illustrious Washington, the Continental Congress, and by all those
who were correctly informed of his proceedings. Even general
Greene was one of his most ardent admirers, whose biographer, long
after the <span class="smcap smaller">SAGE</span> and the <span class="smcap smaller">HERO</span> had mouldered beneath the clods of the
valley, published a tirade of abuse against Mr. Morris that has sunk
Judge Johnson so far below the true dignity of an impartial writer, as
to render the efforts of his envy abortive, and of his malice, powerless.
His extracts from public documents are garbled, his conclusions are
based upon false premises, his innuendoes are ungenerous—his attack
is gratuitous and uncalled for, and has justly recoiled upon the proud
escutcheon of his own fame. The shafts of slander can never indent
the fair reputation of Robert Morris, although hurled like thunderbolts
from the whole artillery of malice and revenge. Upon the enduring
records of our nation his actions stand in bold relievo, bright as the
moon, clear as the sun, and as withering to the opposition of his enemies
as the burning sands of Sahara. His honest fame will endure,
unimpaired, the revolutions of time.</p>

<p>From the day he assumed the high charge of superintendent of
finance, his duties were onerous and multifarious. It was some time
after the strong solicitations of Congress were urged upon him before
he consented to undertake the delicate and difficult task of managing
this department, to which he was elected on the 20th of
February, 1781, a dark and dismal period of the revolution. A
deep sense of public duty finally induced him to undertake the
gigantic work, and in a masterly manner did he execute it. He
immediately instituted an examination of the public debts, revenue,
and expenditures; he reduced to an economical system the mode
of regulating the finances, and of disbursing the public funds; he
executed the plans of Congress relating to all monetary matters;
he superintended the action of all persons employed in obtaining and
distributing supplies for the army; he attended to the collection of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
monies due to the United States, either by loans from Europe, from
the states, or otherwise; he held a supervision over all the contractors
for military supplies; he provided for the civil list; he corresponded
with the executive of each state, and with the ministers of the United
States, then in Europe for the purpose of obtaining aid, urging upon
them the necessity of raising money, and necessarily transacted much
business with every department of the government. At the same time
he was an active member of the legislature of Pennsylvania. The
effects of his powerful financial mind soon invigorated the desponding
cause of liberty. Through the agency of the bank of North America,
united with his personal responsibility, he improved the national credit,
and introduced a rigid economy through all the avenues of public
operations. He found himself in an Augean stable, but was the Hercules
that could effectually cleanse it. Corrupt agents and corrupting
speculators fled before his searching scrutiny, hissing like serpents
retiring to their dens.</p>

<p>In all things he acquitted himself nobly, and stood approved by
Congress, by his country, his conscience and his God. It is a lasting
eulogium upon his name, that he reduced all his transactions to so
perfect a system, committing them all to writing, that he was able to
produce a satisfactory voucher for each and every public act during
is whole career—a circumstance worthy of remark and of imitation.
System is the helm, ballast, and mainmast of business.</p>

<p>At the final close of the war, Mr. Morris, fatigued in mind and
body, tendered his resignation, which was not accepted by Congress
until November, 1784. A large amount of his own notes, given on
account of supplies for the government, were then out. To impart
confidence to those who held them, he issued a circular, pledging himself
to meet them all at maturity, which pledge he faithfully redeemed.
At the time of his resignation, he placed himself in the crucible
of an examining committee appointed by Congress, before whom he
exhibited a perfect map of all his public acts. After the investigation
closed, the report of the committee placed him on a lofty eminence,
as an able financier and an honest man.</p>

<p>He was solicited by President Washington to accept of the appointment
of secretary of the treasury, which he respectfully declined.</p>

<p>Mr. Morris was a member of the convention that framed the federal
constitution, and was elected to the first national senate that convened
after its adoption. He seldom entered into debate, but when
he did, he was truly eloquent, chaste, and logical. He was always
heard with great attention, and exercised a powerful influence in the
legislative body. His speech in the Pennsylvania legislature against
the continental currency, was a specimen of eloquence and conclusive
reasoning, seldom surpassed, He also wrote with great facility and
strength of language. Although not a classical scholar, he possessed
an inexhaustible store of useful and practical information, derived
from the richest sources, and applicable to all the public and private
relations of life.</p>

<p>When the peace of 1783 proclaimed his country free from further
invasion, Mr. Morris again entered largely into commercial speculations.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
In 1784 he sent a ship to Canton, which was the first that displayed
the star spangled banner in that port. He was also the first
who attempted the “out of season” passage to China, by doubling the
south cape of New Holland, and astonished the English navigators by
the arrival of his ship at a season of the year before deemed impracticable.
He was the first man who introduced hot and ice houses
in this country. He was a friend to every kind of improvement, and
did all in his power to promote the interests of his fellow men and of
his country. After spending a long life in managing, most skilfully,
millions upon millions of capital, he at last split upon the fatal rock
of land speculation, and closed his eventful career in poverty, on the
8th of May, 1806, at the city of Philadelphia, sincerely mourned by
his country and deeply regretted by his numerous and devoted friends.
He had long been afflicted with the asthma, and suffered much during
the last years of his useful life. He met the grim messenger of death
with fortitude and resignation, and bid a final adieu to earth and its
toils, without a murmur or a sigh.</p>

<p>The private character of this public benefactor was, in all respects,
amiable, pure, and consistent. He was a large man, with an open,
frank, and pleasing countenance, gentlemanly in his manners, and
agreeable in all his associations. He was most highly esteemed by
those who knew him best. Although no proud monument of marble is
reared over his ashes, his name is deeply engraved upon the tablet of
enduring fame, and will be revered by every true American and patriot
until the historic page shall cease to be read, and civilization
shall be lost in chaos.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_19">JOHN WITHERSPOON.</h2>
</div>

<p>The man who places his confidence in the Supreme Ruler of revolving
worlds, leans upon a sure support, that earth can neither
give nor take away. When we can appeal to Heaven with clean
hands for aid in our undertakings, faith bids us fear no danger.
A large portion of the patriots of the revolution were pious men;
and I am not apprised that one among them, who became conspicuous,
was a disbeliever in an overruling Providence. Several of
them were devoted ministers of the Gospel, among whom was
<span class="smcap">John Witherspoon</span>, a native of the parish of Yester, near Edinburgh,
Scotland, born on the 5th of February, 1722. He was a
lineal descendant of the celebrated John Knox, the heroic reformer
of Scotland. The father of John Witherspoon was the minister of
the above named parish, and was instrumental in moulding the mind
of his son in the paths of wisdom, virtue and science. He placed
him at an early age in the Haddington school, where his young mind
unfolded its rich beauties, with all the fragrance of a spring flower.
He soared above the trifles and allurements that too often lead childhood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
and youth astray, and made his studies his chief delight. He
manifested a maturity of judgment, a clearness of conception, and a
depth of thought rarely exhibited in juvenile life. At the age of
fourteen years he entered the university of Edinburgh, where he
fully sustained the high anticipations of his friends, and gained the
esteem and admiration of his fellow students and the professors. His
acquirements in the theological department were of a superior order.
At the age of twenty-one, he passed the ordeal of his final examination,
and received a license to proclaim to the world the glad tidings
of the everlasting Gospel.</p>

<p>He immediately became the assistant of his revered father, and
gained the affection and confidence of his parishioners, and the admiration
of all who heard him and delighted in plain practical piety.</p>

<p>In 1746, on the 17th of January, he was a “looker on in Venice”
at the battle of Falkirk, and was seized by the victorious rebels, with
many others whose curiosity had led them to the scene of action, and
imprisoned in the castle of Doune. After he was released from this
confinement, he resided a few years at Beith, and subsequently at
Paisly, rendering himself highly useful as a faithful and exemplary
preacher. During his residence at the latter place, he received
urgent calls from the people of Dublin, Rotterdam and Dundee, in
Europe; and an invitation to accept of the presidential chair of the
college of New Jersey, in America, to which, at the suggestion of
Richard Stockton, then in London, he was elected on the 19th of
November, 1766. A general demurrer was entered against his
acceptance by his numerous relations and friends, with whom his
wife at first participated. The delights of his native home and the
horrors of the American wilderness, were held up before him in fearful
contrast. A bachelor relation of his, who was very wealthy,
offered to will to him his large fortune if he would decline the solicitation
of the trustees of the college. For more than a year he
refused to accept of the invitation. During that time, his lady
caught what was called “the missionary fever,” and not only freely
consented to embark for the new world, but exerted herself to remove
every impeding obstacle. On the 9th of December of the following
year, Mr. Stockton had the pleasure of communicating to the
board of trustees the acceptance of Dr. Witherspoon, which was
most joyfully received.</p>

<p>He arrived with his family in the early part of the ensuing August,
and on the 17th of that month was inaugurated at Princeton. His
literary fame, which had been previously spread through the colonies,
gained an immediate accession of students to the institution, and
gave a new impetus to its action, although it had been ably conducted
by his worthy predecessors. The high reputation of the new
president gave him an extensive influence, of which he prudently
availed himself to resuscitate and replenish the empty treasury of
the college by obtaining donations from private and public sources.
He also introduced the most thorough and harmonious system throughout
all its departments, and fully answered the most sanguine anticipations
of his warmest friends. His mode of instruction was calculated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
to expand the ideas of his students, and launch them upon the sea of
reflection and investigation. He dispelled the dogmatical and bewildering
clouds of metaphysical fatality and contingency, and of unmeaning
and abstruse physiology, that hung like an incubus over the old
schools. He illumined their understandings with the rays of scientific
truth, founded upon enlightened philosophy, sound reason, plain
common sense, and liberal principles. He taught his pupils to explore
the labyrinthian mazes of human nature, and the revolving
circuit of their own immortal minds. He raised before them the
curtain of the material, moral, physical and intellectual world; and
delineated, by lucid demonstration, their harmonious connection and
unity, perfected by the grand architect of this mighty machinery made
for man. He pointed out to them the duties they owed to themselves,
their fellow men, their country, and their God. He imbued their
souls with charity, the golden chain that reaches from earth to Heaven:
He taught them how to live and be useful, and how to throw off
their mortal coil, when called to “that country from whose bourne no
traveller returns.” His instructions were luminous and enriching;
his precepts were fertilizing to every mind on which they fell, capable
of receiving an impression.</p>

<p>On the flood tide of a high and merited literary and theological
fame, Dr. Witherspoon floated peacefully along, until the revolutionary
storm drove him from his citadel of classics and the pulpit
of his church to a different sphere of action. Before he immigrated
to America he understood well the relations between the mother
country and the colonies. He was master of civilian philosophy,
international law, monarchial policy, and the principles of rational
freedom. The enrapturing beauties of liberty, and the hideous deformities
of tyranny, passed in review before his gigantic mind. In
the designs of creative wisdom he saw the equal rights of man and
determined to vindicate them. He at once took a bold stand in
favour of his adopted country. With an eagle’s flight he mounted
the pinnacle of political fame; with a statesman’s eye he calmly surveyed
the mighty work to be performed by Columbia’s sons. The
plan of political regeneration and independence stood approved by
Heaven, and he resolved to lend his aid in the glorious cause. Most
nobly did he perform his part.</p>

<p>From the commencement of the revolution he was a member of
various committees and conventions formed for the purpose of seeking
redress from the king, by <em>peaceable</em> means if possible, by <em>forcible</em>
means if it became necessary. He was a member of the Convention
of New Jersey that formed its republican constitution of 1776. On
the 20th of June of the same year, he was elected to the Continental
Congress, and advocated, by his powerful and eloquent reasoning,
the declaration of our rights, to which he affixed his name, appealing
to his God for the approval of the act, and to the world for the justice
of the cause he espoused. He was continued a member of that august
body until 1782, with the exception of one year, and contributed
largely in shedding lustre over its deliberations. With a mind
and intelligence able to grasp, comprehend, and expound the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
minutiæ of legislation and government, he combined a patriotic devotion
and holy zeal for the interests of his bleeding country. His
labours were incessant, his industry was untiring, his perseverance
was unyielding, and his patriotism was as pure as the crystal fountain
or pellucid stream.</p>

<p>During the time he served in the legislative halls, he did not neglect
the higher honours of the vineyard of his Lord and Master.
He was often at the family altar, in the closet and in the pulpit; and
was esteemed as one of the most able, eloquent, and profound
preachers of that eventful period. He was one of the brightest ornaments
of the religion of Christ, and one of the strongest advocates of
the cause of liberty. As a speaker, he was listened to with deep
interest; as a logical and systematic debater he had few equals.
His arguments were aposteriori, apriori and afortiori; leading the
mind from effect to cause, from cause to effect, and deducing the
stronger reasons. His memory was remarkably retentive, his judgment
acute, and his perceptions clear. He was a member of the
secret committee of Congress, the duties of which were arduous and
delicate. He was a member of the committee appointed to co-operate
with general Washington in replenishing and regulating the
army; of the committee of finance, and of various other and important
committees. Several eloquent appeals to the people from Congress
recommending special days to be set apart for public fasting and
prayer, were from his nervous and vigorous pen. The melting and
burning manifesto, protesting against the inhuman and barbarous
treatment of the American prisoners confined on board the filthy
prison ships at New York, was supposed to have been written by
him. From his mode of reflecting and reasoning, Dr. Witherspoon
was prophetic in pointing out the results of propositions laid before
Congress, and opposed all those that he believed would terminate
unfavourably. Against the emission of continental paper money he
strongly remonstrated. His predictions of its depreciation were soon
verified. In March, 1778, one dollar and three quarters of paper
money were worth but one silver dollar; one year from that time the
rate was two for one; in five months after it was eighteen for one;
the next year it was forty for one; shortly after, seventy-five for
one; and in a few more months, one hundred and fifty for one; and
finally became worthless.</p>

<p>Most of the measures he proposed when he commenced his career
in Congress were either then or subsequently adopted with success,
and those that he opposed unsuccessfully, terminated unfortunately
in almost every instance. So closely and deeply did he investigate
and probe every subject that came before him, that his powers of
penetration became proverbial.</p>

<p>Whether in the halls of classic literature, the ecclesiastical courts,
or upon the floor of Congress, he was a shining light to those around
him. His literary, political, and theological writings was numerous,
of a high order, and are justly celebrated in Europe as well as in this
country. They exhibit a pleasing and rich variety of thought; a strong
and brilliant imagination; a luminous and flowing fancy; a keen and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
sarcastic wit; a chaste and fascinating style; broad and liberal views;
philosophic and reasonable propositions; clear and convincing conclusions;
all softened and embalmed by heaven-born charity and universal
philanthropy.</p>

<p>At the close of the session of Congress in 1779, he was induced to
resign his seat in consequence of his ill health, and a serious affection
of the nerves, producing dizziness, that sometimes suddenly prostrated
him. Being relieved from the more arduous duties of superintending
the college at Princeton by the vice president, the Rev.
Dr. Samuel Smith, his son-in-law, he sought the enjoyments of retirement.
These were allowed to him but a brief period. In a little
more than a year he was again elected to Congress, and when he
finally resigned in 1782, he was shortly after persuaded by the trustees
of the college, at the age of sixty, to embark for England for the
purpose of obtaining funds to aid the seminary over which he presided.
His exertions were laudable, but his mission unsuccessful. He opposed
the project as visionary before he started; he demonstrated the
correctness of his opinion when he returned in 1784.</p>

<p>He then retired to his country seat about one mile from Princeton,
there to participate in the blessings of peace, of liberty, of independence,
and of fame, the golden fruits that had been richly earned by years
of peril and of toil. Surrounded by fond relatives and devoted friends;
enjoying the gratitude and praise of a nation of freemen; his name
immortalized as a civilian, a statesman, a patriot, a scholar, and a
divine, he could sit down beneath the bright mantle of a pure conscience
and an approving Heaven; and, through the bright vista of the
future, gaze upon a crown of enduring glory, prepared for him in
realms of bliss beyond the skies. He was peaceful and happy.</p>

<p>In this manner he glided down the stream of life until the 15th of
November, 1794, when he fell asleep in the arms of his Lord and
Master, calm as a summer morning, serene as the etherial sky, welcoming
the messenger of death with a seraphic smile. His remains
rest in the church yard at Princeton.</p>

<p>A review of the life of this great and good man, affords an instructive
lesson worthy to be engraven upon the heart of every reader. He
was endowed with all the qualities calculated to ennoble and dignify
the creature, and assimilate him to the Creator. His superior virtues
completely eclipsed his human frailties, and placed him on a lofty
eminence beyond the reach of envy, malice, or slander. His fame,
in all its varied and refulgent hues, spreads a lustre over his name
that will brighten and shine until the last death knell of liberty shall
be sounded, and social order shall be lost in the devouring whirlpool
of chaos.</p>

<p>In all the relations of private and public life, he stood approved,
admired, and revered. Let us all endeavour to imitate his examples
of virtue, the crowning glory of talent, that our lives may be useful in
time, and our final exit tranquil and happy.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_20">THOMAS LYNCH, <span class="smcap">Jr.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Revolutionary struggles, predicated solely upon political ambition
and partisan principles, often produce the most bitter persecution between
those whose ties of consanguinity and friendship are seldom
severed by other incidents. To the credit of our nation, instances of
this kind were very rare during the struggle for American independence.
In the field of battle, sire and son fought shoulder to shoulder;
in the public assemblies, they united their eloquence in rousing the
people to action.</p>

<p>A pleasing illustration of the mutual devotion of father and son
to the same glorious object, is found in the history of <span class="smcap">Thomas Lynch</span>,
Jr., and his venerable parent. Their paternal ancestors were of Austrian
descent, and highly respectable. The branch of the family
from which the subject of the present sketch descended, removed
to Kent in England, from thence to Ireland, a son of which, Jonack
Lynch, emigrated from Connaught to South Carolina, in the early
part of its settlement. He was the great grandfather of Thomas
Lynch, Jr., and was a man of liberal views and of pure morality.
Thomas Lynch, the father of the subject of this brief narrative, was
his youngest son, and imbibed, at an early age, the patriotic feelings
that rendered him conspicuous at the commencement of the revolution.
By his industry and enterprise in agricultural pursuits he
amassed a large fortune, and was able and disposed to give this, his
only son, a superior education.</p>

<p>Thomas Lynch, Jr., was born upon the plantation of his father on
the bank of the North Santa river, in the parish of Prince George,
South Carolina, on the 5th of August, 1749. In early childhood he
was deprived of the maternal care of his fond mother, who was the
daughter of Mr. Alston, by relentless death. At a proper age he was
placed at the Indigo Society School, then in successful operation at
Georgetown in his native state, where some of the most eminent sages
of the southern colonies received their education.</p>

<p>Warmed by the genial rays of the sun of science the germ of the
young mind of Thomas Lynch, Jr. soon burst from its embryo state,
and exhibited a pleasing and luxuriant growth. His progress in the
exploration of the fields of literature was creditable to himself and
highly gratifying to his indulgent parent and numerous friends. So
rapid was his improvement, that at the early age of thirteen, his father
placed him at the famous school at Eton, Buckinghamshire, England,
founded by Henry VI., where he commenced his classical studies.
After completing his course there, he was entered as a gentleman
commoner in the University of Cambridge, where he became a finished
scholar and an accomplished gentleman, esteemed and respected by
all who knew him. He then had his name entered in the Law Temple,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
and made himself familiar with the elementary principles of legal
knowledge, and prepared himself thoroughly to act well his part
through future life. During his stay, he cultivated an extensive acquaintance
with the whigs of England, which gave him an opportunity
of acquiring a knowledge of the policy and designs of British
ministers with regard to the American colonies. He took a deep
interest in the relative situation of the two countries, and returned
home in 1772, prepared and determined to oppose the oppressions of
the crown and strike for <span class="smcap smaller">LIBERTY</span>. As the dark clouds of the revolution
gathered in fearful array, the firmness of his purposes increased.
These were fostered and encouraged by his patriotic father, and responded
to by the people of his parish. Hand in hand did the sire
and son march to the rescue of their country from the iron grasp of
tyranny.</p>

<p>The first attempt of Thomas Lynch, Jr., at public speaking, after
his return from Europe, was at a large town meeting at Charleston.
His father had just addressed the assembled multitude on the subject
of British oppression, amidst the enthusiastic cheers of his fellow citizens.
As he sat down his youthful son rose. A profound silence
ensued. A thousand eyes were turned upon him. For a moment he
paused; his eyes were fixed, his bosom heaved; the struggle was over,
and a strain of eloquence followed that carried the insulating fluid of
patriotism to the hearts of his astonished and delighted audience with
irresistible force. Tears of joy ran down the furrowed cheeks of his
father, and loud bursts of applause were shouted by the enraptured
assembly.</p>

<p>When the final crisis for physical action arrived, Mr. Lynch was
among the first to offer his services. In July, 1775, he accepted of the
commission of captain, and repaired to Newbern, North Carolina,
where he unfurled the star spangled banner, and in a few weeks enlisted
the number of men required for his company. His father objected
to his acceptance of so low a commission, to whom his affectionate
son modestly replied, “My present command is fully equal to
my experience;” a reply worthy of the consideration of every young
person who desires to build his fame upon a substantial basis. If a
man is suddenly placed upon a towering eminence to which he is unaccustomed,
the nerves of his brain must be unusually strong if he
does not grow dizzy, tremble, totter, and fall. If he ascends gradually,
and pauses at the different points of altitude, he may reach the
loftiest spire, preserve his equilibrium and be safe. Sudden elevations
are uniformly dangerous. On his way to Charleston with his
men, Captain Lynch was prostrated by the bilious fever, brought on
by the fatigues and exposures of his new mode of life. From this
attack he never entirely recovered. Towards the close of the year
he so far regained his health as to be able to join his regiment. Soon
after, he received intelligence of the dangerous illness of his father,
then a member of Congress at Philadelphia. He immediately applied
to Colonel Gadsden, his commanding officer, for permission to visit
him, which was peremptorily refused, on the ground that the necessity
for his services in the army was paramount to all private considerations.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
This difficulty was unexpectedly removed by his election to
Congress, as the successor of his father, by an unanimous vote of the
assembly of his state. He received the information with deep emotions
of diffidence and gratitude. He promptly repaired to his new
and dignified station, and took his seat in the Congress of 1776, composed
of sages and statesmen whose combined talents and wisdom
have no parallel in ancient or modern history. On his arrival at Philadelphia
he found his father partially relieved from his paralytic affection,
and in August he attempted to return to South Carolina, but
only reached Annapolis, where he expired in the arms of his son who
was soon to follow him.</p>

<p>On his entrance in the national legislature, Captain Lynch became
a bold and eloquent advocate of the Declaration of Independence, and
gained the reputation of being an able statesman and a firm patriot.
He most cheerfully and fearlessly affixed his name to the charter of
our rights, and did all in his power, and more than his feeble state of
health warranted, to promote the glorious cause of <span class="smcap smaller">FREEDOM</span>. He was
finally compelled to yield to increasing disease, and relinquish his public
duties. Medical skill proved unavailing, and by the advice of his
physicians he undertook a voyage to Europe, a change of climate being
the only thing that promised him relief. Near the close of the year
1779, himself and lady sailed with Captain Morgan, whose vessel was
never heard from after she had been a few days at sea. The last account
of the unfortunate ship was from a Frenchman, who left her from
some cause unknown and went on board of another, shortly after which
a violent tempest arose and unquestionably sent her, with all on board,
to the bottom of the ocean.</p>

<p>Previous to his embarking, Captain Lynch, having no issue, willed
his large estate to his three sisters in case of the death of himself and
wife.</p>

<p>The private character of this worthy man was unsullied, and in all
respects amiable. Had his valuable life been spared, he would undoubtedly
have rendered his country eminent services, and maintained
an elevated rank among the patriots and sages of the eventful era he
saw so gloriously commenced. During his short career, he performed
enough to immortalize his name. Although his morning sun never
reached its meridian, its splendour contributed largely in illuminating
the horizon of <span class="smcap smaller">LIBERTY</span>, and shed a lustre over his memory enduring
as time.</p>

<p>The brief but brilliant career of <span class="smcap">Thomas Lynch, Jr.</span>, admonishes us
that life is held by a slender tenure, and that high accomplishments,
like some rich flowers, often bloom just long enough to be admired
and revered, then withdraw their beauties from our enraptured sight
forever.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_21">MATTHEW THORNTON.</h2>
</div>

<p>In the sages of the American revolution, we recognise every variety
of character that ennobles man and confers upon him dignity and merit.
To rouse the people to a becoming sense of their inalienable and
chartered rights, and to induce them to rise in the majesty of their
might and vindicate them, was the first great business of the illustrious
patriots who boldly planned and nobly achieved American independence.
To effect this important object, all the varied forms and powers
of eloquence were necessary, from the mighty torrent of logic that
overwhelms, the keen sarcasm that withers, to the mild persuasion
that leads the heart a willing captive.</p>

<p>The latter talent was pre-eminently possessed by <span class="smcap">Matthew
Thornton</span>, who was born in Ireland in 1714, and immigrated to this
country with his father, James Thornton, in 1717, who settled at
Wiscasset, Maine. This son received a good academical education,
and was much admired for his industry, correct deportment, and
blandness of manners. After completing his course at school, he
commenced the study of medicine with Dr. Grout, of Leicester,
Massachusetts. He made rapid progress in the acquisition of that
important branch of science, and gave early promise of future and extensive
usefulness. When he became prepared to enter upon the
duties of his profession, he commenced practice in Londonderry, New
Hampshire, which was principally settled by immigrants from his
native country. He soon acquired a lucrative business, and the confidence
and esteem of his numerous patrons.</p>

<p>In the expedition against Cape Breton, then belonging to the French,
he was appointed surgeon of the New Hampshire division of the invading
army, and performed his duty with great fidelity, skill, and
credit.</p>

<p>He was an early and prominent advocate of American rights—a
bold and uniform opposer to the usurpations of the British ministry.
He had a great opportunity to disseminate liberal principles among
the people, which did not pass unimproved. When the revolutionary
storm burst upon the colonies, he had command of a regiment of
militia in Londonderry. He also held the commission of justice of
the peace, and had filled various civil offices. His urbanity of manners,
sincerity and honesty of purpose, and uncommon powers of persuasion,
gave him a rare and salutary influence, both in private parties
and public assemblies.</p>

<p>He was appointed president of the first provincial convention of
New Hampshire, after the dissolution of the king’s government. The
people of that state, for a time, did not come up to the line marked
out by the patriots of Massachusetts, but Dr. Thornton, and other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
leading men, soon brought them into the rank and file of opposition
to the invading foe, and redeemed them from the bonds of servitude
and fear. In 1774, they sent delegates to the Congress convened at
Philadelphia, and in December of that year, when they were apprised
of the order of the king in council prohibiting the exportation of gunpowder,
the committee of safety in the town of Portsmouth collected
a body of men, who, before the governor was apprised of their intention,
seized upon the fort and carried off one hundred barrels of that
then important commodity.</p>

<p>Soon after the flight of Governor Wentworth upon receiving the
intelligence of the battle of Lexington, an address was prepared by a
committee of the provincial convention, of which Dr. Thornton was
president, which was published over his signature. To the young
reader this may seem unimportant, until it is known it was full evidence
to convict him of high treason, and would have doomed him to
the scaffold had he fallen into the hands of his enemies. Hence, the
patriotism and boldness of the act.</p>

<p>The address was couched in strong and feeling terms, well calculated
to produce the intended effect. The following extract is a fair
sample of the whole: “You must all be sensible that the affairs of
America have at length come to an affecting crisis. The horrors and
distresses of a civil war, which, till of late, we only had in contemplation,
we now find ourselves obliged to realize. Painful, beyond
expression, have been those scenes of blood and devastation which
the barbarous cruelty of British troops have placed before our eyes.
Duty to God, to ourselves, to posterity, enforced by the cries of
slaughtered innocents, have urged us to take up arms in our own defence.
Such a day as this was never before known either to us or to
our fathers. We would therefore recommend to the colony at large
to cultivate that christian union, harmony, and tender affection
which is the only foundation upon which our invaluable privileges
can rest with any security, or our public measures be pursued with
the least prospect of success.”</p>

<p>On the 10th of January, 1776, Dr. Thornton was appointed a Judge
of the Superior Court of New Hampshire, and on the 12th of September
he was elected a member of the Continental Congress, and when
he took his seat affixed his name to the Declaration of Independence.
For those who are not correctly informed upon the subject it is natural
to suppose that the signers of the chart of our liberty were present
on the memorable 4th of July when it was adopted. This was
not the case. Messrs. Franklin, Rush, Clymer, Wilson, Ross, and
Taylor, as in the case of Dr. Thornton, were not members on that
day. Nor does the name of Thomas M’Kean appear upon the printed
records of Congress, although he was present and signed on the 4th
of July; and the name of Henry Wisner, a delegate from Orange
county, New York, who signed the original manuscript of the declaration
on the day it was adopted, has never been properly recognised.
These errors were undoubtedly clerical, not intentional. Mr. Wisner
was a highly respectable member, and a pure and zealous patriot.</p>

<p>Dr. Thornton discharged the duties of his important station ably and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
faithfully until his services were required upon the bench. On the
24th of December of the same year, he was again elected to Congress,
and served until the 23d of January, 1777, when he retired finally
from the national legislature, highly esteemed by all his associates,
enjoying the full confidence and gratitude of his constituents, and the
proud satisfaction of having performed his duty towards his country.
For six years he served on the bench of the Superior Court, and was
also Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; the combined duties of
which rendered his task arduous. In 1779, he removed to Exeter,
and the following year purchased a plantation upon the banks of the
Merrimack river, where he sought that repose that his advanced age
required. His friends, however, were not willing to excuse him from
acting in public concerns, and induced him to serve as a member of
the general court, and also in the state senate during the war, and for
two years after its close. On the 25th of January, 1784, he was appointed
a justice of the peace and quorum throughout the state, which
was an important office under the original constitution of the state,
but which was abolished in part, and abridged in jurisdiction, by the
amendments of 1792. This he held to the day of his final retirement
from all public duties; and, after 1785, he took no part in the politics
of the day, but continued to afford salutary counsel on all important
matters relative to the public weal, about which he was often consulted.
During the controversy between his state and Vermont concerning
a portion of disputed territory, he wrote several letters to
those in power, urging the necessity of conciliatory measures, and an
unconditional submission to the decision of Congress in the premises.
They were highly creditable to him as an able patriot, a good writer,
and a discreet man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thornton</span> was one of the most fascinating and agreeable men
of his age. He was seldom known to smile, but was uniformly cheerful,
entertaining, and instructive; similar, in many respects, to the
illustrious Franklin. His mind was stored with a rich variety of useful
and practical knowledge, which rendered him an interesting companion.
He sustained an unblemished private reputation, and discharged
all the social relations of life with fidelity and faithfulness.
He was opposed to sectarian religion, belonged to no church, but was
devoutly pious and a constant attendant of public worship. He was
a kind husband, an affectionate father, and a good neighbour. He
was very exact in collecting his dues, by some thought too severe,
and was rigidly scrupulous in liquidating every farthing he owed.
He was a large portly man, over six feet in height, well proportioned,
with an expressive countenance, enlivened by keen and penetrating
black eyes. He died at Newburyport, Massachusetts, on the 24th
of June, 1803, whilst visiting his daughter. His remains were conveyed
to New Hampshire, and deposited near Thornton’s Ferry,
on the bank of the Merrimack, where a neat marble slab rests over
his dust, with this laconic and significant <span class="locked">epitaph—</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_22">WILLIAM FLOYD.</h2>
</div>

<p>Private virtue and undisguised sincerity were marked characteristics
of the revolutionary patriots. They were actuated by pure
and honest motives, and not by wild ambition and political phrenzy.
Noisy partisans and intriguing demagogues were not the favourites
of the people during the war of independence. The man of genuine
worth and modest merit was the one whom they delighted to honour
and trust.</p>

<p>In the character of <span class="smcap">William Floyd</span> these qualities were happily
blended. He was a native of Suffolk, Long Island, in the state of
New York, born on the 17th of December, 1734. His grandfather,
Richard Floyd, immigrated from Wales in 1680, and settled at Setauket,
Long Island. During his childhood he was remarkable for frankness
and truth, and for amiableness of disposition and urbanity of
manners. He was an industrious student, and acquired a liberal
education. During the prosecution of his studies, he preserved his
health in its full vigour, by devoting a short period almost, daily to
the use of his gun, in pursuit of game, the only diversion to which he
was ardently attached. This exercise gave his system a healthy tone,
and enabled him to master his lessons with more accuracy than some
who confine themselves exclusively to their rooms, and become debilitated
for the want of physical action. Upon the health of the body
the improvement of the juvenile mind very much depends—exercise
in the open air should not be neglected.</p>

<p>The father of William M’Nicoll Floyd died before this son arrived
at his majority, and left him an ample fortune. He managed it with
prudence and economy, and when his country was doomed to pass
through the fiery furnace of a revolution, he was one of the most opulent
and influential men on Long Island. From his youth he had been
the advocate of liberal principles, and opposed to the innovations of
the British ministry, upon the chartered rights of the American colonies.
As oppression increased, his patriotic feelings were more frequently
and freely expressed, and when the Congress of 1774 convened
at Philadelphia, he was an active and zealous member. By
his uniform candour and purity of purpose, he gained the unlimited
confidence of his constituents and of his country. His cool deliberation
and calm deportment, under all circumstances, were well calculated
to preserve an equilibrium among those of a more fiery temperament
and of more rashness in action. The Congress of 1774 was remarkable
for clear and unanswerable argument, calm and learned
discussion, wise and judicious plans, and reasonable but firm purposes.
The course pursued operated powerfully and favourably upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
the minds of reflecting men, whose influence it was important to obtain
and secure.</p>

<p>Mr. Floyd also had command of the militia of his native county,
and when the British attempted to land at Gardner’s Bay, promptly
assembled them, and repelled the invading foe. In 1775 he was again
chosen a representative in Congress, and became one of its active and
efficient members. He was emphatically a working man, and engaged
constantly on important committee duties. During his absence at
Philadelphia, the British obtained possession of Long Island, and
forced his family to flee for their safety to Connecticut. His property
was materially injured by the enemy, and his mansion-house converted
into a military barrack, for the accommodation of the invaders of
his country. For seven years he was deprived of all resources from
his plantation, and was dependant upon his friends for the protection
of his family. The year following he was again elected to a seat in
the Continental Congress, and had the satisfaction of affixing his name
to the declaration of independence, which he had advocated from its
incipient stages to the time of its adoption. In 1777 he was elected
to the first senate of the state of New York, convened under the new
order of things. He immediately became a prominent and leading
member, and rendered important services in forming a code of republican
laws for the future government of the empire state, carefully
guarding the rights of person and property inviolate.</p>

<p>In January, 1779, he again took his seat in the Continental Congress,
and entered upon the duties of his station with the utmost vigour
and industry. On the 24th of the ensuing August, he resumed
his station in the senate of his native state. Much important
business was before the legislature, requiring wisdom, energy, and
unity of action. To devise some plan of relief from a depreciated
currency and a prostrate credit, was an important item. Mr. Floyd
was at the head of a joint committee appointed for this purpose, and
reported a plan that proved him to be an able financier and a man of
deep thought and investigation. It was predicated upon a gradual
and just system of taxation, to be carried into effect by responsible
and honest agents, with good and sufficient sureties for the payment
of all monies collected to the proper officer—the state treasurer. In
October of that year, Mr. Floyd, Ezra L’Hommedieu, and John Loss
were appointed by the New York legislature delegates to a convention
of the eastern states convened for the purpose of devising some
system by which supplies of provisions could be more readily obtained
and preserved from the grasp of avaricious monopolists.</p>

<p>Immediately after the discharge of the duties assigned him, he again
took his seat in Congress. On the third of December he was elected
one of the board of admiralty, and on the thirteenth of the same month
a member of the treasury board. By incessant application to the
various duties that devolved upon him, his health became impaired,
and in April following he obtained leave of absence. In June he repaired
to the senate of New York, and was immediately appointed
upon a joint committee to act upon resolutions of Congress, involving
the important relations between the state and general government.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
He opposed, unsuccessfully, the plan of making bills of credit a legal
tender, but had the pleasure in after life of seeing the principles he
then advocated sanctioned and adopted.</p>

<p>In September he was appointed upon a committee of the senate to
prepare a reply to the message of the governor. To effect a proper
organization of the general government, was the anxious desire of the
state legislatures. To confer upon Congress all necessary powers,
strictly defined and plain to be understood, was considered the only
safe policy to insure future safety. To this important subject the
governor had drawn the particular attention of the members. The
committee reported several resolutions on this point, which were
adopted and forwarded for the consideration of the national legislature.
They recommended the enactment of laws that should produce
an equal responsibility upon each of the states to bear its <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro rata</i>
proportion of the burden of the war, in the way and manner that
should be devised by the general government. In 1780 he was again
returned to Congress. In addition to the usual duties, he was instructed
by an act of the legislature, together with the other members
from New York, to obtain a settlement of the claims of his native
state, and those of New Hampshire, to the territory now comprising
the state of Vermont. This was a vexed question that required much
industry and wisdom to manage. These were eminently possessed
by Mr. Floyd, who, on that occasion, as upon all others, discharged
his duties to the entire satisfaction of his constituents. He also, during
the same session, introduced a resolution for the cession of the
western territories to the United States. He also nominated, on the
10th of August, Robert L. Livingston as secretary of foreign affairs,
who was immediately appointed to that important station.</p>

<p>In addition to serving in the senate of his own state, more or less
every year, he continued an active member of Congress until 1783,
when he joined in the general joy of triumphant victory and heart-cheering
peace, and was once more permitted to return and take possession
of the ruins of his once flourishing plantation, amidst the congratulation
of his numerous friends, all animated by the resplendent
glories of <span class="smcap smaller">LIBERTY</span>. In order that he might repair his private fortune,
he declined the urgent request of his constituents to consent to a re-election
to Congress. He however continued to serve in the senate
of his native state until 1788, when he was returned a member of the
first Congress under the federal constitution. Worn out in the service
of his country, he retired at the end of his term from the public
arena, and once more entered upon the enjoyments of domestic bliss.</p>

<p>Being possessed of a large tract of valuable land upon the banks of
the Mohawk river, then a dense wilderness, he commenced gradual
improvements upon it, and in 1803 took up his final residence there.
His friends often urged him to again become a member of the national
legislature, but he declined entering upon any laborious public duties,
except serving the district to which he removed one term in the state
senate, and also of serving as a member of the convention of 1801, to
revise the constitution of New York. He was four times a member
of the electoral college of his state for the election of president and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
vice-president, and in 1800 he travelled two hundred miles to give
his vote for his old companion and friend, Thomas Jefferson, in the
dreary month of December.</p>

<p>He continued to improve his new plantation until he saw the wilderness
blossom as the rose, and his mansion surrounded by happy neighbours,
all basking in the clear sunshine of that freedom he had been
instrumental in acquiring. Envy was a stranger to his philanthropic
and patriotic bosom; he rejoiced in the happiness of the whole human
family; he delighted in the prosperity of all around him.</p>

<p>In all things he was a practical man, free from pomp and vanity,
and systematic in all his proceedings. When his purposes were formed,
he prosecuted them with an unyielding energy that was seldom
arrested or thwarted. He was possessed of a clear head, a strong
mind, a good heart, a vigorous and sound judgment, matured by long
experience and a close observation of men and things. He spoke but
little in public assemblies, and rarely entered into debate. Happy
would it be for our country if we had more men like William Floyd at
the present day, instead of so many who <em>talk</em> more than they <em>work</em>.
Long speeches hang like an incubus over our legislatures, and those
who feel disposed, are prevented by them from doing the business of
the people promptly.</p>

<p>In all the private relations of life William Floyd presented a model
as worthy of imitation as that of his public career. He was warm in
his friendships, and most scrupulously honest in all his transactions.
His feelings and morals were of a refined cast, and the most rigid integrity
marked his every action. He thought and acted for himself,
and left others to do the same. He marked out his path of duty from
the reflections of his own mind, and pursued it steadily and fearlessly.
For more than fifty years he enjoyed the full fruition of popular
favours, and only one year before his death was elected a member of
the electoral college. His physical powers were remarkable until a
short time before his last illness. He was a man of middle size, well
formed, and of easy deportment. He was dignified in his general appearance,
and affable in his manners. For the last two years of his
life his health was partially impaired, and on the 1st of August, 1821,
he was seized with general debility, and on the fourth day he folded
his arms calmly, closed his eyes peacefully, and met the cold embrace
of death with the fortitude of a sage, a patriot, and a Christian. Although
general Floyd did not possess the Ciceronian eloquence of an
Adams, a Jefferson, or a Henry, he was one of the most useful men of
his day and generation. His examples and his labours shed a lustre
over his character, as rich and as enduring as the fame of those who
shone conspicuously in the forum. He was an important link in the
golden chain of liberty, and was so esteemed by all his associates in
Congress. The working man was then properly appreciated. The
most powerful orators of that eventful era were concise and laconic.
Long speeches were as uncommon as they are now pernicious and unnecessary.
The business of our nation was performed promptly, expeditiously,
effectually, and economically. Let us imitate the examples
of the patriots of the times that tried their souls, and preserve,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
in its native purity, the rich boon of liberty they have transmitted to
us. Let us emulate the virtues of general <span class="smcap">William Floyd</span>, and we
shall be highly esteemed in life, deeply mourned in death, and our
names will survive, on the tablet of enduring fame, through the revolutions
of time.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_23">WILLIAM WHIPPLE.</h2>
</div>

<p>A common error that has gained credence among mankind, consists
in a belief that to obtain a sufficient share of knowledge to enable a
man to appear advantageously upon the theatre of public action, he
must spend his youthful days within the walls of some celebrated
seminary of learning. In the view of many, it is necessary for a young
man to commence his career under the high floating banner of a collegiate
diploma in order to ensure future fame.</p>

<p>That a refined classical education is a desirable and high accomplishment,
I admit; that it is indispensably necessary, and always
renders a man more useful, I deny. The man who has been incarcerated
from his childhood up to his majority within the limited circumference
of his school-room and boarding-house, although he may
have mastered all the sciences of the books, cannot have acquired
that knowledge of men and things necessary to prepare him for action
in private or public life. Polite literature is <em>one</em> thing, useful knowledge,
fit for every day use, is <em>another</em>, and of vital importance. By
proper application a man may obtain both, and that without entering
college. The field is open to all, especially under a republican form
of government. Franklin and Sherman, both humble mechanics, became
finished scholars and profound philosophers without the aid of
collegiate professors. I do not design to deteriorate the usefulness
of high seminaries of learning, but to stimulate those who have native
talent and cannot enjoy their advantages, to imitate the examples
of those who have risen to high stations of honour and distinction by
the force of their own exertions, unaided by these dazzling lights.</p>

<p>Among the self taught men of our country the name of <span class="smcap">William
Whipple</span> stands conspicuous. He was the eldest son of William
Whipple, and born at Kittery, Maine, in 1730. He was educated in
a common English school, where he was taught reading, writing,
arithmetic, and navigation. These branches he mastered at an early
age, and was then entered as a cabin boy on board of a merchant vessel,
which was in accordance with the wishes of his father and his
own inclination. Before he arrived at the age of twenty-one years,
he rose to the station of captain and made several successful voyages
to Europe. Some writers have attempted to cast a stigma upon his
character at that era of his life, because, in a few instances, he participated
in the slave trade. If they will learn the general feeling that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
pervaded the minds of a large proportion of the civilized community
at that time upon this subject, their anathemas will vanish in thin air.
The trade was then sanctioned by the king of Great Britain, under
whose government captain Whipple acted, and, according to the
English law, <em>the king can do no harm</em>. The correctness of the principle
was not then disputed or agitated generally, and the trade was
ingrafted in the commercial policy of the mother country. That Captain
Whipple became convinced upon reflection of the unjustness and
barbarity of the traffic, fully appears from his subsequent acts. At
the commencement of the revolution he manumitted the only slave he
owned, who adhered to his old master during the war, and fought
bravely for our liberties. If every man is to be condemned for the
errors of youth, whose riper years are crowned with virtue, the list of
fame will be robbed of many bright constellations.</p>

<p>In 1759, captain Whipple relinquished his oceanic pursuits, and
commenced the mercantile business in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
He also married Miss Catharine Moffat, and entered upon a new scene
of life. During his numerous voyages he had become celebrated as a
skilful navigator and a judicious commanding officer. He had carefully
treasured a large fund of useful knowledge by close observation,
attentive reading, and by mingling, when in port, with none but intelligent
and good company. He had listened, both in England and
America, to the unwarranted pretensions of the former, and the increasing
complaints of the latter. He had made himself familiar with
the chartered rights of his own country, and with the usurpations
of the crown over his fellow citizens. He was prepared to take a
bold stand in favour of freedom. He took a conspicuous part in public
meetings, and was chosen one of the committee of safety. He rose
rapidly in public estimation, and the former cabin boy became a leading
patriot. In January, 1775, he represented Portsmouth in the
Provincial Congress, convened at Exeter, for the purpose of choosing
delegates for the Continental Congress. On the 6th of January of the
following year he was chosen a member of the provincial council of
New Hampshire, and on the 23d of the same month, a delegate to the
national legislature at Philadelphia, of which he continued a distinguished,
active, and useful member, until the middle of September,
1779. He was present at the adoption of the Declaration of Independence,
and affixed his name to that sacred and bold instrument with
the same fearless calmness with which he would have signed a bill of
lading.</p>

<p>He was emphatically a working man, and from his extensive knowledge
of business, rendered himself highly useful on committees. As
a member of the marine and commercial committees, his practical
knowledge gave him a superiority over his colleagues. He was also
appointed one of the superintendents of the commissary and quartermaster
department, and did much towards correcting abuses and
checking peculation. He was untiring in his industry, ardent in his
zeal, philosophic in his views, pure in his purposes, and strong in his
patriotism. When he finally retired from Congress to serve his country
in another and more perilous sphere, he carried with him the esteem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
and approbation of all his co-workers in the glorious cause of liberty.
On his return to his constituents he was hailed as a <span class="smcap smaller">SAGE</span>, a <span class="smcap smaller">PATRIOT</span>,
and a <span class="smcap smaller">HERO</span>.</p>

<p>In 1777 he had received the appointment of brigadier-general, and
was put in command of the first brigade of the provincial troops of
New Hampshire, acting in concert with General Stark, who commanded
the other. At that time General Burgoyne was on the flood
tide of his military glory in the north, spreading consternation far and
wide. He was first checked in his triumphant career by General
Stark, at Bennington, Vermont. General Whipple, about the same
time, joined General Gates with his brigade, and was in the bloody
battles of Stillwater and Saratoga, where the palm of victory was
attributed in a great measure to the troops under his command. In
the consummation of the brilliant victory over the British army under
Burgoyne, which shed fresh lustre on the American arms, General
Whipple contributed largely. Colonel Wilkinson and he were the
officers who arranged and signed the articles of capitulation between
the two commanders. He was also selected as one of the officers to
conduct the conquered foe to Winter Hill, near Boston. His faithful
negro, whom he manumitted at that time, participated in all the perils
of his old master, and seemed as much elated with the victory as if
he had been the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>In 1778, General Whipple was with General Sullivan at the siege
of Newport, which was necessarily abandoned in consequence of the
failure of the anticipated co-operation of the French fleet under Count
D’Estaing, which was unexpectedly injured in a gale of wind. A
safe and fortunate retreat was effected in the night, which saved that
portion of the American army from total destruction.</p>

<p>In 1780 General Whipple was appointed a commissioner of the
board of admiralty by Congress, which honour he did not accept, preferring
to serve in the legislature of his own state, to which he had
just been elected, and in which he continued for a number of years.</p>

<p>In 1782 he was appointed by Robert Morris financial receiver for
the state of New Hampshire, which conferred upon him the highest
eulogium for integrity and honesty. The office was arduous, unpopular,
and irksome, but he performed its duties faithfully until the 2nd
of July, 1784, when he resigned. In conjunction with the many honourable
stations he filled, he was appointed a judge of the superior
court on the 20th of June, 1782, and on the 25th of December, 1784,
was appointed a justice of the peace and quorum throughout the state,
which offices he held to the day of his death. He was also one of the
commissioners on the behalf of Connecticut, who met at Trenton to
settle the unpleasant controversy between that state and the commonwealth
of Pennsylvania, relative to the lands in Wyoming valley. In
all the multiform public duties that devolved upon him, he acquitted
himself nobly, and retained, to his last moments, the entire confidence
of his country. He possessed a strong and analyzing mind, a
clear head, a good heart, and deep penetration of thought. In all the
relations of private and public life, from the cabin boy up to the lofty
pinnacle of fame on which he perched, he maintained a reputation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
pure as the virgin sheet. During the latter part of his life, he suffered
much from disease in his chest, which terminated his useful and patriotic
career on the 28th of November, 1785. Agreeably to his
request before his death, his body underwent a post-mortem examination.
His heart was found ossified; the valves were united to the
aorta, and an aperture, not larger than a knitting needle, was all that
remained for the passage of the blood in its circulation. This accounted
for his having often fainted when any sudden emotion excited
a rapid flow of his life stream.</p>

<hr />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_24">FRANCIS HOPKINSON, <span class="smcap">Esq.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Times of high excitement, terminating in an important crisis, big
with interests and events, tend greatly to the developement of character
and talent. Thus, during the revolution, many talents were
brought to light and action, that a supremacy of kingly power would
have crushed in embryo, and left them to perish, unseen and unknown.</p>

<p>Amongst the actors on that memorable stage we find a variety of
characters, showing the powers of mind in all their varied forms and
shades, from the sedate and grave Washington, to the sprightly and
witty Hopkinson, and the pithy and original Franklin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Francis Hopkinson</span> was the son of Thomas Hopkinson, of Philadelphia,
born in 1737. His father was a man of superior talents and
high attainments, his mother was one of the best of Heaven’s gifts.
At the age of fourteen, death robbed Francis of his father, and left
his mother to struggle, with limited means, with all the accumulating
difficulties of maintaining and educating a large family of fatherless
children.</p>

<p>Under her guidance and instruction, young Francis soon evinced
talents that promised well for him and his country. She used every
exertion to improve his education, depriving herself of all the luxuries,
and many of the comforts of life, to advance the interests of her
children. Being a devoted Christian, she took peculiar care and delight
in planting deep the purest principles of virtue, guarding their
minds against all the avenues of vice and sin. She taught them the
design of their creation, the duty they owed to their God and fellow
men, and that to be truly <em>happy</em>, they must be truly <em>good</em>. The
foundation being thus firmly laid, she placed her favourite son, the
future hope of her family, at the University of Pennsylvania, where
he completed his studies and graduated. He then commenced a successful
study of law under Benjamin Chew, Esq., and became a close
and thorough student, making great proficiency in his judicial acquirements.
He possessed a brilliant and flowing fancy, a lively
imagination, a captivating manner, and was partial to polite literature
as well as the more solid sciences. He was fond of poetry, music,
and painting. He excelled in humorous satire, keen as that of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
prototype Swift. Fortunately, these talents were made to subserve,
pre-eminently, the cause of patriotism, science and philanthropy—the
consequent result of deep-rooted morality.</p>

<p>In 1765, he visited London, where he continued two years, making
himself acquainted with the feelings and designs of the British
parliament towards the Colonies, who had already began to feel
oppression.</p>

<p>On his return he married the amiable Miss Ann Borden, of Bordentown,
N.&nbsp;J.; and soon found himself surrounded by all the accumulating
cares of a rising family. In rearing his children, his mind
was often carried back to the manner his venerable and esteemed
mother had instructed him during his childhood. He could adopt
no better plan or find no brighter example to follow. But the comforts
of “sweet home” were soon to be interrupted. His country
needed his services, which were cheerfully and promptly rendered.
He was among its warmest and most zealous patriots. It was for
him to do much in opening the eyes of the great mass of the people
to a just sense of the injuries inflicted by the mother country. This
he did by various publications, written in a style so fascinating and
humorous as to be universally read; painting, in true and glowing
colours, the injustice of the crown and the rights of the colonists.
His Pretty Story—his Letters to James Rivington—his Epistle to
Lord Howe—his two Letters by a Tory—his translation of a Letter
written by a Foreigner—his Political Catechism—and the New Roof,
were all productions of taste and merit, and were of vast importance
in rousing the people to a vindication of their rights and the achievement
of their liberties.</p>

<p>During the administration of Governor Dickinson, political dissensions
and party spirit spread their mountain waves over Pennsylvania,
threatening to destroy the fair fabric of her new government. The
pen of Mr. Hopkinson was again instrumental in restoring order.
In an essay, called “A full and true account of a violent uproar
which lately happened in a very eminent family,” he exposed the
factious partizans to such keen and severe ridicule, that they threw
down the weapons of their rebellion much sooner than if a thousand
bayonets had been pointed at their breasts.</p>

<p>He was among the first delegates elected to the Continental Congress,
and most cheerfully and fearlessly recorded his name on that
declaration which has proved a consolation to the friends of <span class="smcap smaller">FREEDOM</span>,
but a Boanerges to the enemies of <span class="smcap smaller">LIBERTY</span>. Always cheerful and
sprightly, he contributed much in dispelling the gloom that often pervaded
the minds of his colleagues in the midst of disaster and defeat.
He knew the cause was righteous—he believed that Heaven would
crown it with triumphant victory and ultimate success. He had
sacrificed a lucrative situation in the loan office, held under the
crown, at the shrine of liberty; he had embarked his fortune, his life,
and his sacred honour, in defence of his country—and, with all his
humour and wit, he was firm and determined as a gladiator. With
the fancy of a poet, he united the soundness of a sage; with the wit
of a humorist, he united the sagacity of a politician. He succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
George Ross as Judge of the Admiralty court, and was subsequently
one of the United States District Judges; and was highly esteemed
for his judicial knowledge, impartial justice, and correct decisions.—He
filled every station in which he was placed with credit, honour,
and dignity. He continued to contribute, by his writings, much towards
correcting the morals of society, by ridiculing its evils and
abuses—Sarcasm and satire, properly timed, and guided by a sound
discretion, are the most powerful and cutting instruments ever wielded
by man. Their smart upon the mind is like cantharides upon the skin,
but often requires a more powerful remedy to heal it. The wit of
Mr. Hopkinson was of a noble cast, flowing from a rich and chaste
imagination, never violating the rules of propriety, always confined
within the pale of modesty, but keen as a Damascus blade. He was an
admirer of sound common sense, and a zealous advocate of common
school education. He appreciated correctly the bone and sinew of
our country, and knew well that the perpetuity of our liberties depends
more upon the general diffusion of <em>useful</em> knowledge, fit for
<em>every</em> day use in the various business concerns of life, than upon the
high-toned literature of colleges and universities. He admired the
industrious tradesman; he respected the honest farmer. In the yeomanry
of the soil and inmates of shops, he saw the defenders of our
country. <span class="smcap">Mr. Hopkinson</span> was like some rare flowers, that, while
they please by their beauty, they possess powerful qualities to alleviate
distress and impart comfort. He was amiable and urbane in
his manners; open and generous in his feelings; noble and liberal in
his views; charitable and benevolent in his purposes; an agreeable
and pleasant companion; a kind and faithful husband; an affectionate
and tender parent; a stern and inflexible patriot; a consistent and
active citizen; a valuable and honest man.</p>

<p>His career was closed suddenly and prematurely by an apoplectic
fit, on the 9th of May, 1791, in the 53d year of his age, and in the
midst of his usefulness. He left a widow, two sons, and three daughters,
to mourn his untimely end, and their irreparable loss.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_25">JOSIAH BARTLETT.</h2>
</div>

<p>The profession of medicine in the hands of a skilful, honest, judicious,
upright, and accomplished man, is one of the richest blessings
in community, and one of the most honourable employments. Over
his acquaintances, the influence of “the Doctor” is greater, when we
include all classes, than that of any other profession; consequently,
in the cause they espouse, physicians can wield an influence more
powerful than many imagine. It is with pleasure I remark, that among
the signers of the Declaration of Independence we find a goodly number
from this highly honourable and useful profession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Among them was Dr. <span class="smcap">Josiah Bartlett</span>, who was the son of Stephen
Bartlett, of Amesburg, Massachusetts. Josiah was born in November,
1729. He early manifested a strong and vigorous mind, which
was cultivated by an academical education. Possessing a retentive
memory, he acquired the Latin and Greek languages, and finished
the course assigned him at the early age of sixteen. He then commenced
the study of medicine under Dr. Ordway, and pursued it assiduously
for five years. He then commenced a successful practice
at Kingston, where he soon became generally and favourably known
and highly esteemed. Two years after he commenced his professional
career, he was reduced so low with a fever that his physician gave up
all hopes of his recovery. By an experiment of his own his life was
saved. He induced those who were attending upon him to furnish
him with cider, small and frequent quantities of which he took, a perspiration
ensued, the fever was checked, and he recovered. From
this time forward, he closely watched in his patients the operations
and wants of nature, and often successfully deviated from the stubborn
rules that were laid down in books written in other countries and
climates. With a physician of an acute and discerning judgment,
matured by skill and experience, this practice is safe. Dr. Bartlett
was the first who discovered, in that section of country, that the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">angina
maligna tonsillaris</i>, or canker, was <em>putrid</em>, instead of <em>inflammatory</em>,
and the first who administered the successful remedy of Peruvian
bark for this disease. He also introduced the successful practice
of using antiphlogistic remedies for the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cynanche maligna</i>, or
sore throat; by which disease hundreds of children were suddenly
torn from the arms of their fond parents, three or four being frequently
buried in one grave from the same family. Under the skilful
hands of Dr. Bartlett this disease was checked in its career.</p>

<p>Enjoying the unlimited confidence of his numerous acquaintances
he was promoted to several important stations, both civil and military,
under Governor Wentworth, discharging his duty with ability and
approbation. In 1765 he was elected to the legislature of New Hampshire,
where he soon became prominent from his steady and firm opposition
to the infringements of the crown upon the rights of the colonists.
Republican in all his views and feelings, he watched, with an
eagle eye, the movements of the British ministry and the royalists
around him. In granting charters to towns, the royal governors had
uniformly reserved to themselves, and for the use of episcopal churches,
the <em>cream</em> of the location. This injustice roused the indignation of
the advocates of justice and equal rights, among whom Dr. Bartlett
stood in the foremost rank. The burdens of taxation by the mother
country were also severely felt and strenuously resisted. In effecting
their early settlements, the colonists had been left unaided and unprotected
to struggle with the stubborn wilderness and cruel savage.
They were now unwilling to allow themselves to be stripped of their
hard earnings to gratify the extravagant luxuries and avarice of the
creatures of the crown. Resistance was natural—it was right. Taxation
and representation are inseparable principles; without the one
the other should not, cannot exist with an enlightened people. Power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
is not always a creature of justice, and often adopts the principle
that “might makes right.” Upon this corrupt and sandy foundation
the British ministry based their conduct towards the colonies.
Starting upon these false premises, their harsh measures recoiled upon
them with a force that levelled their superstructure to the dust. For
a time the cords of oppression were partially slackened, the stamp act
was repealed, a spirit of conciliation seemed to pervade the heart of
the king, but his old preceptor, lord Bute, in conjunction with lord
North, soon induced him to sanction measures more oppressive and
arbitrary than those previously complained of. The tax on tea was
received with more indignation than the stamp act, and the popular
rage soon rose to a foaming fury.</p>

<p>Governor Wentworth thought to secure Dr. Bartlett by appointing
him a member of the judiciary; but he could not be seduced by any
trappings from the crown, and continued to oppose the innovations
of the royalists. The minority in the legislature, to which the doctor
belonged, was fast increasing, and to prevent a majority against his
own views, the governor obtained the king’s writ for three new members
from townships not entitled to an additional representation.
This act of injustice disgusted many of the members who had not
espoused the cause of liberal principles, and determined them to
enlist under the banner of freedom. Opposition grew bolder under
every act of oppression; private meetings were held, committees
of correspondence and safety were appointed, a concert of feeling
was produced through most of the colonies, and plans of resistance
were rapidly taking the place of petitions to the king. Governor Wentworth
several times dissolved the assembly at the commencement of
its sessions, until he so exasperated the members and people as to virtually
dissolve his own authority, and was obliged to seek safety on
board the man-of-war Forney. The three new members had been expelled
from the legislative body, a warfare commenced between the
adherents of the crown and the friends of equal rights; Dr. Bartlett
and others were deprived of all authority within the control of the
governor, the line of demarcation was drawn, and the tocsin of war
was sounded.</p>

<p>Dr. Bartlett was one of the members elected by the eighty-five
delegates convened for the purpose at Exeter, on the first of July,
1774, to meet the general Congress at Philadelphia. In consequence
of the recent destruction of his house by fire he was compelled to decline
the appointment at that time, but in September of the year following
he took his seat in that patriotic body. Simultaneous with
his election to Congress, he was appointed to the command of a regiment
of provincial troops. In Congress he performed his duties with
great zeal, industry, and ability. He was uniformly placed on the
most important committees, whose duties occupied their time until a
late hour at night. Congress met at nine in the morning, and sat
until four in the afternoon. After this hour the arduous duties of the
committees were performed. When we contemplate the labours of
the Continental Congress, surrounded as they were by difficulties on
every side, a tremendous storm bursting over their heads, retreating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
from place to place before a victorious foe; their country bleeding at
every pore, without resources, their army almost annihilated, the
only rational conclusion to be drawn how they were sustained is derived
from the fact, that many of its members were consistent and
devoted Christians, firmly relying upon Him who rules the destinies
of nations to support them and crown their efforts with victory and
success. Nor did they trust in vain.</p>

<p>In 1776, Dr. Bartlett was again elected to Congress and took a
conspicuous part in the discussion of separating from the mother
country. Amongst the patriots there were many who doubted the
propriety of this determination in consequence of their weakness. A
concert of feeling was eventually produced and a decided majority
declared in favour of emancipation. On the fourth of July the final
question was put to each member. Commencing with the most northern
colony, Dr. Bartlett was the first who was called. Firmly relying on
the justice of the cause, with his eyes raised to heaven, he responded
<span class="smcap smaller">YEA</span> and <span class="smcap smaller">AMEN</span>; and laid the first stone in the base of the fair fabric of
liberty, now towering in majesty over our happy land. Next to the
president, the venerable John Hancock, Dr. Bartlett was the first who
signed that invaluable instrument which gave our nation birth, and
at one bold effort burst the chains of slavery and dissolved the
power that had been swayed, with an iron hand, over the oppressed
and bleeding colonies.</p>

<p>Worn down with the fatigue of arduous duties, Dr. Bartlett found
his health declining and was not able to take his seat in Congress
after the close of this session, until 1778. He was, however, enabled
to be useful to his native state in her civil departments, and also aided
greatly in raising troops for the northern army. When Congress assembled
at York Town Dr. Bartlett again resumed his seat. Although
re-elected to the succeeding term, this was the last of his
attendance in that body. His domestic concerns had suffered from
his absence in the public service, and he obtained leave to remain at
home. His services were immediately required by his fellow citizens
of New Hampshire. He was appointed chief justice of the common
pleas and muster master of the troops, then enlisting for the continental
service. In 1782 he was appointed a justice of the superior
court, and six years after, chief justice.</p>

<p>The usefulness of Dr. Bartlett did not close with the war. Although
victory had crowned the efforts of the patriots, and their independence
had been achieved, much remained to be done. Numerous
conflicting interests were to be reconciled, a system of government
was to be organized, an enormous debt was to be paid, many abuses
and corruptions were to be corrected, a concert of feeling and action to
be produced, and the art of self-government to be learned. In my
view the wisdom of the patriots and sages of the revolution shone more
conspicuously in perfecting our system of government, than in driving
the foe from our shores. It is a task of no small magnitude to reduce
a nation from a seven years’ war to a civil and quiet government, entirely
different from the one to which it has been accustomed. It often
requires more sagacity and wisdom to retain and enjoy, than to obtain
an object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Thus, with regard to our independence, after it was obtained, storms
arose that threatened utter destruction and ruin. It required the combined
wisdom of the wisest legislators to preserve it. Long and arduous
were the labours that effected a confederated consolidation.
During the time this subject was under discussion, many of the states
were shook to their very centre by internal commotions. That concert
of action and feeling that had carried the people triumphantly
through the revolution, was now, with a great mass of the community,
lost in the whirlpool of selfishness. Fortunately for our country and the
cause of liberty, those who stood at the helm during the storm of war
still remained at their posts. Their labours resulted in the adoption
of that constitution under which we have enjoyed a prosperity before
unknown. Dr. Bartlett was a member of the convention of his native
state for the adoption of the consolidating instrument, and gave it his
warm and efficient support. In 1789 he was chosen a member of the
national senate, the next year president of New Hampshire, and in
1793 he was elected the first governor of the state. He enjoyed universal
confidence and esteem, and discharged his duties with so much
wisdom and integrity, that slander and envy could find no crevice for
an entering wedge. Worn down by years of arduous toil, old age
fastening its wrinkled hand upon him, and the confines of the eternal
world just before him, he resigned his authority and closed his public
career on the 29th of January, 1794, covered with laurels of immortal
fame, without a spot to tarnish the glory of his bright escutcheon.</p>

<p>Governor Bartlett now retired to private life, anticipating the
enjoyments that are peculiarly pleasing to men who accept of public
stations from a sense of duty rather than a desire to acquire popularity
for the sake of advancement. But his fond anticipations were
soon blasted. Disease fastened its relentless grasp upon him, his
amiable wife had died six years before, the world had lost its charms,
and, on the 19th of May, 1795, his happy spirit left its tenement of
clay, ascended to Him who gave it, leaving a nation to mourn the loss
of one of its brightest ornaments, one of its noblest patriots.</p>

<p>In the life of this estimable man, we behold one of the fairest pictures
spread on the pages of history. His public career was of that
discreet and solid character, calculated to impart enduring and substantial
usefulness. Without dazzling the eyes of every beholder,
his course was onward in the cause of philanthropy and human rights.
He could look back upon a life well spent; he stood acquitted and
approved at the dread tribunal of conscience. He had nobly acted
his part, fulfilled the design of his creation, discharged his duty to
his country and his God, and filled the measure of his glory.</p>

<p>In his private character he was all that we could desire in a patriot,
a citizen, a friend, a husband, a father and a Christian. No man
was more highly esteemed by all who knew him—no man more richly
deserved it.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_26">ARTHUR MIDDLETON.</h2>
</div>

<p>Those who are familiar with the history of England, with her constitution,
with her great Magna Charta, and with the usurpations of
men in power upon the rights of British subjects at various periods,
can readily conceive why so many men of high attainments and liberal
minds immigrated to America. Disgusted with oppression at home
they sought liberty abroad. The cause that prompted them to leave
their native land, impelled them to action when imported tyranny invaded
their well-earned privileges. The mind of every immigrant
patriot was as well prepared to meet the crisis of the revolution, as
that of a native citizen. The feelings created by remembered injuries,
which drove them from the mother country, rendered them as
formidable opponents to the unjust pretensions of the crown as those
who had never breathed the atmosphere of Europe.</p>

<p>In tracing our own history back to the early settlements, we find
an almost constant struggle between the people and the officers sent
by the king to govern them; the former claiming their inherent rights,
the latter frequently infringing them.</p>

<p>Among those whom at an early period boldly espoused the cause of
freedom was Edward Middleton, the great grandfather of the subject
of this brief sketch, who immigrated from Great Britain near the close
of the seventeenth century, and settled in South Carolina. His son,
Arthur Middleton, imbibed all the feelings of his father, and in 1719,
when the crown officers became insolent beyond endurance, he stood
at the head of the opposition that boldly demanded and obtained their
removal. His son, Henry Middleton, the father of Arthur, whose
biographette is my present object, also inherited the same bold patriotism,
and took a conspicuous part in rousing his fellow citizens to action
at the commencement of the revolution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arthur Middleton</span>, the subject of this memoir, was born in 1743,
at Middleton place, on the banks of Ashley river, where his father
owned a beautiful plantation. His mother was a Miss Williams, the
only child of a wealthy and reputable planter. Arthur was the eldest
of his father’s children, and received all the advantages of an early
education. At the age of twelve years he was placed in the celebrated
seminary of Hackney, near London, and two years after, was transferred
to the classic seat of learning at Westminster. He applied himself
with great industry to his studies, excelling in all he undertook,
and gained the esteem and respect of those around him. In his nineteenth
year he became a student at the University of Cambridge, and
four years after, graduated with the degree of bachelor of arts, a profound
scholar and a virtuous man. Trivial amusements and dissipation,
which had ensnared many of his classmates, had no charms for
him. Although an heir to wealth and liberally supplied with money,
economy was his governing principle, wisdom his constant guide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
After he had completed his education he spent nearly two years in
travelling, making the tour of Europe. Familiar with the Greek and
Roman classics, he enjoyed peculiar satisfaction in visiting Rome
and other ancient seats of literature. He possessed an exquisite taste
for poetry, music, and painting, and was well versed in all the technicalities
of sculpture and architecture. After completing this tour
he returned home. Soon after his arrival, he led the amiable and
accomplished Miss Izard, daughter of Walter Izard, to the hymeneal
altar.</p>

<p>About a year after, he embarked with his wife for England. After
enjoying a pleasant season with their friends and connexions there,
they visited France and Spain, and in 1773, returned home and located
on his native spot, which his father bestowed upon him, placing
him at once in possession of an ample fortune.</p>

<p>Having resided so long in Great Britain, possessed of an observing
mind, tracing causes and results to their true source, he was well
qualified to aid in directing the destiny of his country through the
approaching revolution. Rocked in the cradle of patriotism by his
father, tracing its fair lines in the history of his ancestors, he acted
from the genuine feelings of his heart when he boldly espoused the
cause of liberal principles and human rights. The Middletons were
the nucleus of the opposition in South Carolina. Unlike many others
who mounted the stage of public action for the first time, untried and
almost unknown, this family had been proved and their influence was
felt throughout the colony, and was known in the mother country.
Hence the importance of their services at the commencement of the
doubtful struggle, and for the same reason they were peculiarly obnoxious
to the creatures of the crown. Aristocracy, too often the
attendant of riches, found no resting place in their bosoms. The very
marrow of their bones was republican, and to defend their country’s
rights they freely pledged “their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred
honours.”</p>

<p>Arthur Middleton was a member of the different committees that
were appointed by the people to devise means of safety. On the 17th
of April, 1775, he was one of the committee of five, in South Carolina,
that determined to have recourse to arms, and under whose direction
the royal magazine was entered, in defiance of the king’s officers,
and its contents put into the hands of the people for their defence.</p>

<p>On the 14th of June following, the provincial Congress of this state
appointed a council of safety, consisting of thirteen persons, of whom
Arthur Middleton was one. They were fully authorized to organize
a military force, and adopt such measures as they deemed necessary
to arrest the mad career of the royalists. Mr. Middleton was one of
its boldest and most decided members, and appears to have been much
chagrined at the temporizing spirit of some of his colleagues.</p>

<p>That he possessed a penetrating sagacity as well as a firm patriotism,
appears from the following circumstance.</p>

<p>During the session of the first provincial Congress of South Carolina,
the new governor, Lord William Campbell, fresh from his majesty,
arrived to enter upon the duties of reducing the rebellious subjects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
to subordination. He was all mildness and did not pretend to
justify the oppressions of which the people complained. To prove his
sincerity, Captain Adam M’Donald, one of the council, was introduced
to Lord William as a tory from the upper country, who
seemed anxious to have some means devised to put down the rebels.
The plan succeeded. The governor desired him and his friends to
remain quiet for the present, as he expected troops in a short time that
would put a quietus upon the <em>new fangled</em> authorities.</p>

<p>When the report of this interview was laid before the council, Mr.
Middleton, although nearly related to the governor by marriage, made
a motion to have him immediately arrested and confined. This measure
was too bold for his timid companions, a majority of whom voted
against it. Soon after, his excellency retired on board a British sloop
of war and did not venture to return until accompanied by Sir Henry
Clinton and Sir Peter Parker, who showed more bravery than judgment
in their unsuccessful attack on Fort Moultrie. In this engagement
Sir William was severely wounded, and Sir Peter had his silk
breeches badly mutilated by the unceremonious course of a rebel cannon
ball.</p>

<p>On the 11th of February, 1776, Mr. Middleton was one of the committee
that drafted the first constitution of his native state. Soon
after this he was elected a member to the Continental Congress, taking
a conspicuous part in its deliberations. Bold in all his movements,
he advocated, and by his signature sanctioned the declaration of independence,
then called by many the death-warrant of the fifty-six, but
ultimately proving the warrant of <span class="smcap smaller">LIBERTY</span>, the morning star of <span class="smcap smaller">FREEDOM</span>.
Mr. Middleton was a man of few words in debate—these few
words were to the point, and gave him a substantial influence in every
legislative body of which he was a member. He stood at the head of
the delegation of his state. He possessed a strong mind, a clear head,
and a good heart. He exercised plain common sense, attending diligently
to the business of his constituents and his country. He was
on the most intimate terms with John Hancock and was by him highly
esteemed. He remained in Congress until the close of the session of
1777. The following year he was elected governor of South Carolina,
not knowing that he was a candidate until his election was announced.
The mode was by secret ballot by the members of the
assembly, who had not then learned the art of intrigue and caucusing—merit
was the only passport to office—management and corruption
dared not show their hydra heads.</p>

<p>For the same reasons that induced Governor Rutledge to resign a
few days previous, Mr. Middleton declined accepting the proffered
honour. These reasons were founded in objections to a new constitution,
then before the legislature for adoption, and which required
the sanction of the chief magistrate of the state before it could go into
operation. Mr. Rawlins Lowndes was then elected, who approved
the new form of government on the 19th of March, 1778. Political
candour and honesty were marked traits in the character of Arthur
Middleton. No inducements could swerve him from the path of rectitude.
He weighed measures, men, and things, in the unerring scales<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
of reason and justice. He went with no man when clearly wrong, he
concurred with all whom he believed right. Patriotism, pure and
unalloyed, governed his every action. Discretion, the helm of man’s
frail bark, guided him in the path of duty. Philanthropy and love of
country pervaded his manly bosom. He was sound at the core. His
mind was pure and free as mountain air; his purposes, noble, bold,
and patriotic.</p>

<p>In 1779, when the British spread terror and destruction over South
Carolina, Mr. Middleton took the field with Governor Rutledge, and
cheerfully endured the privations of the camp. He was at Charleston
when General Provost attacked that place, and was found in the front
ranks acting with great coolness and courage. Knowing that the plundering
enemy would visit his plantation, he sent word to his lady to
remove out of danger, but took no means to remove his property, which
fell a sacrifice to the mercenary army. They did not burn but rifled
his house, and several large and valuable paintings that they could
not carry away they defaced in the most shameful manner.</p>

<p>At the surrender of Charleston in 1780, Mr. Middleton was among
the prisoners sent to St. Augustine, and endured the indignities there
practised upon the Americans with heroic fortitude. In July of the
following year he was included in the general exchange, and arrived
safe at Philadelphia. He was shortly after appointed a member of Congress,
and again assumed the important duties of legislation. Soon
after this, the last important act of the revolutionary tragedy was performed
at Yorktown, where the heroes of the revolutionary stage and
of our nation took a closing benefit at the expense of British pride and
kingly ambition. With the surrender of Lord Cornwallis the last
hope of the crown expired in all the agonies of mortification. Had a
spirit of retaliation predominated in the bosom of Washington, awful
would have been the doom of his barbarian, desolating foe. But he
possessed a noble soul that soared above revenge. He sunk his enemy
into the lowest depths of humiliation by kindness and generosity.</p>

<p>In 1782, Mr. Middleton was again elected to Congress, where he
continued until November, when he visited his family, from whom he
had long been separated. At the declaration of peace he declined a
seat in the national legislature, believing the interests of his own state
required his services at home. He was highly instrumental in restoring
order, harmony, and stability in the government of South Carolina.
He was several times a member of its legislature, and used
every exertion to advance its prosperity. During the intervals of his
public duties he spent his time in improving his desolated plantation,
the place of his birth, and of the tomb of his venerable ancestors. He
once more participated in the enjoyments of domestic felicity and
fondly anticipated years of happiness. But, alas! how uncertain are
all sublunary things. In the autumn of 1786, he was attacked with
an intermittent fever, which paved the way for disease that terminated
his life on the first of January, 1787, leaving a wife, two sons and six
daughters, to mourn their irreparable loss. By the public he was
deeply lamented. His memory was held in great veneration by his
contemporaries. He had a strong hold upon the affections of his fellow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
citizens. Those who knew him <em>best</em> esteemed him <em>most</em>. In his
private character he was a consolation to his friends, an ornament to
society, a consistent, honest, and virtuous man. His wife lived until
1814, highly respected and beloved. The example of a good man is
visible philosophy; the memory of departed worth “lives undivided,
operates unspent.”</p>

<p>Among the strange freaks of human nature is that of inconsistency,
showing itself in as many shapes and forms as are exhibited by the
kaleidescope, but of a contrary character. One of its most odious
features is persecution, prompted by jealousy and promulgated by
slander and falsehood. Great and good men are often the victims
of unprincipled and designing partisans, who stop at nothing and
stoop to every thing calculated to accomplish their unholy desires.
In recurring to the eventful period of the American revolution, we
would naturally suppose that party spirit found no place in the bosoms
of any of those who advocated the principles of liberty; that all
were united in the common cause against the common enemy. This
is the impression upon the minds of many, perhaps all who are not
familiar with the history of the local politics of that period. But far
otherwise was the fact. Many of the best men of that trying time
were scourged and lacerated, and their noblest exertions for a time
paralyzed by the reckless hand of party spirit. No one, perhaps,
suffered more from this source, and no one gave less room for censure
than <span class="smcap">James Wilson</span>.</p>

<p>He was born of respectable parents, residing near St. Andrews,
Scotland, in 1742. His father was a farmer, in moderate circumstances,
which he rendered still more limited by rushing into the
whirlpool of speculation, a propensity which unfortunately seems to
have been transmitted to his son. After receiving a good classical
education, having been a worthy student at St. Andrews, Edinburgh,
and Glasgow, James was finished under the master hand of Dr. Blair,
in rhetoric, and of Dr. Watts, in logic. Thus fitly prepared, he immigrated
to Philadelphia in 1766, with letters of high recommendation,
and soon obtained the situation of usher in the college of that city.
His moral worth, combined with fine talents and high literary attainments,
gained for him the esteem and marked respect of Dr. Richard
Peters, Bishop White, and many others of the first rank in society.
Indeed, those who knew him best admired him most.</p>

<p>He subsequently commenced the study of law under John Dickinson,
Esq. and when admitted to the practice, settled permanently
at Carlisle, in Pennsylvania, where he exhibited powers of mind surpassed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
by no one at that bar, and equalled but by few in the province.</p>

<p>A powerful display of his legal knowledge and Ciceronean eloquence
at the trial of an important land cause between the Proprietaries
and Samuel Wallace, gained for him an early celebrity in his
profession. Mr. Chew, who was then attorney-general, is said to
have fixed his eyes upon him soon after he commenced his speech,
and to have gazed at him with admiring astonishment until he concluded.
He was immediately retained in another important land
case, and from that time forward he stood second to no one at the
Pennsylvania bar. He removed from Carlisle to Annapolis, in Maryland,
where he remained a year, and then removed to Philadelphia,
where he obtained a lucrative practice.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the liberal patronage of the public, his circumstances
frequently became embarrassed by unfortunate speculations,
to which he frequently became a victim. Amidst his severest adversities
he frequently sent remittances to his mother, in Scotland, his
father having died and left her poor. To the day of her death he
manifested an earnest and commendable solicitude for her comfort,
and used every means within his power to alleviate her wants and
smooth her downward path to the tomb.</p>

<p>With the commencement of British oppression the political career
of Mr. Wilson began. He freely spoke and ably wrote in favour of
equal rights and liberal principles. He was an early, zealous, and
able advocate of the American cause. Of a consistent and reflecting
mind, he sometimes censured the rashness of those who were less
cool, which laid the foundation for many unjust and malicious slanders
against him, which, in the dark fog of party spirit, several
times enabled his enemies to obtain a momentary triumph over him,
but which were always fully and satisfactorily confuted.</p>

<p>In 1774, a short time previous to the meeting of the Continental
Congress, the provincial convention of Pennsylvania convened to concert
plans for the redress of wrongs imposed by the mother country,
of which Mr. Wilson was a bold and efficient member. So conspicuous
were his talents and so pure his patriotism, that he was nominated
by the same convention one of the delegates to the national
assembly. His appointment was opposed by Mr. Galloway, who had
long been his bitter enemy; but on the sixth of May, 1775, he was
appointed a member of that august body. At the commencement of
hostilities he was honoured with the commission of colonel, and was
one of the commissioners to treat with the Indians. He was continued
a member of Congress until 1777, when his enemies again succeeded
in their machinations against him.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July, 1776, Mr. Wilson, with a bold and fearless
hand, guided by love of country and motives pure as heaven, gave
his vote in favour of independence, and subscribed his name to that
matchless instrument which records the birth of our nation and liberty.
That act alone was sufficient to confute the base slanders circulated
against him, in the minds of all whose eyes were not covered by the
baneful and deceptive film of party spirit. At the shrine of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
dread Moloch, our country’s glory has been too often sacrificed. No
purity of heart, no brilliancy of talent, no pre-eminence of worth, can
save a man from the vile attacks of party spirit. Even Washington,
the father of his country, often writhed under its withering lash.
Some men seem born <em>demagogues</em>, and live under the influence of
Gog and Magog during their whole lives.</p>

<p>As a member of the Continental Congress, Mr. Wilson acted well
his part, and was esteemed as one of its most active and useful
delegates. Coolness and consistency, marked characteristics of the
Scotch nation, were the crimes of Mr. Wilson, on which his enemies
based an accusation that he was not a pure patriot, and that he opposed
the declaration of independence. But those who knew him
well soon convinced the people of the falsity of the slander, and the
character of this great and good man shone with renewed brightness.</p>

<p>On the twelfth of November, 1782, he was again elected to the
national legislature, and the same year was appointed one of the counsellors
and agents of Pennsylvania to attend the court of commissioners
at Trenton, to which was referred the final determination of
the protracted controversy between Connecticut and the Commonwealth
relative to certain lands claimed by the latter within the
limits of the former, situated in Wyoming valley.</p>

<p>The luminous and unanswerable arguments of Mr. Wilson, which
lasted for several days, contributed, in no small degree, to influence
that court to determine in favour of Pennsylvania, and put at rest for
ever an angry litigation of years.</p>

<p>During the interim in which he was not a member of Congress he
held the office of Advocate General for the French nation, which led
him to the close investigation of national and maritime law. At the
close of his services, the French king rewarded him with ten thousand
livres. He was at the same time a director of the bank of North
America, and had the full confidence of Robert Morris as a safe and
able adviser in financial matters.</p>

<p>As an active, clear headed, and discreet member of the most
important committees, Mr. Wilson stood in the front rank. He
weighed every subject with a mathematical judgment, and traced all
its bearings with the compass of wisdom.</p>

<p>He arrived at the desired goal with less parade but with more
certainty than many others, whose zeal was more impetuous but not
more pure than his. He sought more to bestow lasting benefits upon
his bleeding country than to excite the huzzas and gaze of the multitude.
Substantial usefulness is not always found in the foaming
froth of popularity. It lives and is admired long after that transient
vapour has disappeared and left its subject to repose in the peaceful
shades of oblivion. Those who become inflated and rise by the
power of party, vain pride and flattery, may soar aloft in the political
atmosphere, followed by the eyes of thousands, but rely upon it,
in a large majority of instances, their every action is dependent upon
these subtile gases, and they will ultimately prove to be a mere bag of
wind. Modest worth avoids etherial excursions; the terra firma of
deep thought, calm reflection, and sound discretion, constitute its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
most congenial clime. It consents to launch into the revolving vortex
of party with great reluctance, and nothing but a sense of duty
to his country and fellow citizens, can induce a man of genuine merit
to enter the vexatious arena of politics. How many such men are
now in public stations, guarding the rights and directing the destiny
of our nation, is a subject worthy of anxious and careful inquiry. If
the people are not true to themselves, demagogues may easily ride
into office who <em>will not</em> be true to them.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson was one of the most useful members of the convention
that formed our national constitution. He warmly opposed the appointment
of delegates to Congress by the legislatures of the several
states, and was powerfully instrumental in placing their election in
the hands of the people. He was one of the committee which framed
that important document, as first reported to the delegates. When
this model of wisdom received its finishing stroke, Mr. Wilson
warmly advocated its adoption. He was the only member from
Pennsylvania of the national convention that framed the constitution
who had a seat in the convention of that state convened to consider
its provisions. His closing remarks in favour of its acceptance
are worthy the attention of this enlightened age. They manifest a
thorough acquaintance with human nature and with the circumstances
that prompted many to dissent from its ratification.</p>

<p>“It is neither unexpected nor extraordinary, that the constitution
offered to your consideration should meet with opposition. It is the
nature of man to pursue his own interest in preference to the public
good; and I do not mean to make any personal reflection when I
add, that it is the interest of a very numerous, powerful, and respectable
body, to counteract and destroy the excellent work produced by
the late convention. All the officers of government and all the appointments
for the administration of justice and the collection of the
public revenue which are transferred from the individual to the aggregate
sovereignty of the states, will necessarily turn the influence
and emolument into a new channel. Every person, therefore, who
either enjoys or expects to enjoy a place of profit under the present
establishment, will object to the proposed innovation;—not in truth,
because it is injurious to the liberties of his country, but because it
affects his schemes of wealth and consequence. I will confess, indeed,
that I am not a blind admirer of this plan of government, and
that there are some parts of it which, if my wish had prevailed, would
certainly have been altered. But when I reflect how widely men
differ in their opinions, and that every man—and the observation applies
likewise to every state—has an equal pretension to assert his
own, I am satisfied that any thing nearer to perfection could not have
been accomplished. If there are errors, it should be remembered
that the seeds of reformation are sown in the work itself, and the concurrence
of two-thirds of the Congress may, at any time, introduce
alterations and amendments. Regarding it, then, in every point of
view, with a candid, disinterested mind, I am bold to assert, that <span class="smcap smaller">IT
IS THE BEST FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS EVER BEEN OFFERED TO
THE WORLD</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Mr. Wilson was also a member of the convention to alter the constitution
of Pennsylvania, where he acted a very conspicuous part in
defending the elective franchise, as belonging exclusively to the sovereign
people. The last vestige of aristocracy trembled beneath his
powerful eloquence, and the last whisper of slander against his pure,
unsophisticated democracy, was forever silenced and hushed.</p>

<p>The boldest features of liberal principles in the old revised constitution
of Pennsylvania were penned by James Wilson; and, could
<em>his</em> views have been fully incorporated in that instrument, I doubt
much if a convention would ever have been called for its revision.</p>

<p>That the talents and integrity of Mr. Wilson were held in high
estimation by Washington, appears from the fact, that he was appointed
one of the first Judges of the Supreme Court of the United
States, in which office he continued until his death, discharging its
duties with great ability, integrity, and justice. His manner was
dignified, urbane, and pleasing.</p>

<p>In 1790, he was appointed the first professor in the law college of
Philadelphia, and the following year, when the college and university
of Pennsylvania were united, he was called to fill the chair. In
1791, he was appointed by the legislature of that state to revise its
laws, but a disagreement of the two houses relative to the disbursements
necessary to prosecute the work, frustrated the plan. As a
learned and eloquent lawyer, he stood at the head of the Philadelphia
bar. He was honoured with the degree of LL.D. and, during the
first year of his professorship, delivered a course of lectures to the
students. Towards them he was reserved and distant, another
marked characteristic of the Scotch literati. His writings were vigorous
and logical, and did much to disseminate just conceptions of a
republican form of government. As early as 1774, he wrote an essay,
portraying, in language bold and strong, the assumptions of the British
parliament not warranted by their constitution, and painted, in
fascinating colours, the blessings arising from a republican form of
government and the enjoyment of equal rights. To a person unacquainted
with the bitterness of party feeling, it must seem mysterious
that any one could have been found so base as to accuse him of
being an aristocrat. A purer patriot and an abler advocate for the
cause of freedom did not exist among the statesmen and sages of ’76.
He several times passed through the ordeal of severe and relentless
persecution, but truth-telling time, in every instance, forced his enemies
to retrace their steps, covered with shame and disgrace.</p>

<p>The private character of this truly great man was, in all respects,
amiable and untarnished. It always stood beyond the reach of slander,
a pure, unsullied sheet. As a friend, he was warm-hearted and
benevolent; as a husband, kind and affectionate; as a father, discreet
and exemplary; consistently indulgent, and faithful in imparting that
instruction and advice to his children calculated to prepare them for
future usefulness and respect.</p>

<p>In 1798, on the 28th of August, this venerable sage, eminent lawyer,
able statesman, and profound judge, took his exit “to that country
from whose bourne no traveller returns,” in the fifty-sixth year of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
his age. He died whilst on his circuit, of stranguary, in the hospitable
mansion of his colleague, Judge Iredell, in Edenton, North Carolina,
where his ashes rest in peace beneath the clods of the valley.</p>

<p>In reviewing the life of this worthy man, no one can doubt his patriotism
and purity. No one can doubt his devotedness to the American
cause and his firm and uniform opposition to British oppression.
Influenced, as he was, by the noblest motives; guided, as he
was, by liberal principles, it is painful to reflect, that he was often
wounded in the house of his professed friends, and placed under the
castigating lash of persecution by those who had sworn to support the
same cause he so ardently and ably espoused. The solution of the
problem may be found in the present state of things, without travelling
back to that time, of all others, when party should have hidden its
hydra head.</p>

<p>At the present day, the dark intrigues of party are proverbial.
Low cunning is practised by men in the same ranks, to over-reach
an approaching rival, and all the machinery of slander put in requisition
to destroy him. Is he a man of superior talents and worth?
Means proportionably base must be resorted to, in order to insure his
destruction and drive him from the course. Disgusted at such corruption,
the very men best calculated to advance our dearest interests
and add new lustre to our national glory, are those who most dread
the political arena and shrink from the public gaze. How small a
proportion of such men as James Wilson, Benjamin Franklin, and
others of the same stamina, are now to be found in our legislative
halls. We pay large sums of money every year for <em>party</em> legislation,
and but a small proportion of business is accomplished, calculated to
benefit our country. Let the people, the <span class="smcap smaller">YEOMANRY</span>, awake to this
subject, and no longer be led blindfold towards the vortex of destruction.
Unless we are true to ourselves, we need not expect purity
in our legislators. The genuine salt grows less and less as time
advances, and a dangerous carelessness is annually manifested in
selecting men of proper industry and purity of moral and republican
principles to transact our public business. Some of them are
victims of the artful and designing, or are mere partisans, legislating
for themselves and their immediate friends more than for the advancement
of public good and national glory. These are facts that
are self-evident to every reflecting, observing man, facts that demand
our serious attention and timely correction, before the unholy leaven
extends its baneful influence so far as to destroy our beautiful fabric
of <span class="smcap smaller">LIBERTY</span>, and prostrate, at one bold stroke, the hopes of <span class="smcap smaller">FREEMEN</span>.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_28">CHARLES CARROLL, OF CARROLLTON.</h2>
</div>

<p>The fond and faithful parents who have guided to manhood a
family of sons whose every action is a source of pleasure and delight,
who walk in wisdom’s ways, who prove themselves to be bold, generous,
brave, virtuous, and patriotic; whose lives shed new lustre upon
the world, and whose achievements, on the battle field or in the
senate chamber, place them on the loftiest, proudest pinnacle fame
can rear, enjoy a rich, a heavenly consolation, pure as the etherial
skies and cheering as the zephyrs of spring. More especially do
their souls become enraptured with gratitude, if these, their sons, deliver
them from the iron grasp of a merciless tyrant, disenthral them
from the chains of slavery, and make them free and independent.</p>

<p>All this was done for our country by her valiant sons, who graced
the memorable era of ’76. Like a meteor bursting from the clouds
amidst the gloom of midnight darkness, they illuminated the world
with glory, raised the star spangled banner, and planted the tree
of <span class="smcap smaller">LIBERTY</span> deep in the soil of <span class="smcap smaller">FREEDOM</span>. Sages and heroes of the
American revolution! noble sons of Columbia’s new world! your
names will be held in grateful remembrance through the rolling ages
of time, and millions yet unborn will rehearse your brilliant achievements
and triumphant victories, with admiration and praise.</p>

<p>Among the sons of noble daring who stood forth the champions of
their injured and bleeding country, was <span class="smcap">Charles Carroll</span>, of Carrollton,
in the state of Maryland.</p>

<p>This good man, accomplished gentleman, finished scholar, and bold
patriot, was born at Annapolis, on the 20th of September, 1737. He
was the grandson of Charles Carroll, son of Daniel Carroll, of King’s
county, Ireland, the former of whom immigrated to Maryland about
1686, and located at Carrollton. The elder Carrolls were always
found in the foremost rank of those who espoused the cause of liberal
principles, and taught their sons to go and do likewise. Nor did the
seed sown by them fall on a barren soil. Imitating the examples and
obeying the precepts of his patriotic sire, young Charles proved himself
worthy of the high source from whence he sprang. At the early
age of eight years, his embryo talents shone so conspicuously that
his father determined on giving them an opportunity to bud, blossom,
and expand, amidst the literary bowers, and under the cultivation of
a master’s hand in Europe.</p>

<p>He was accordingly sent to France, where his advantages of acquiring
an education were far superior to those then enjoyed in any
of the infant seminaries of the colonies in America. His unremitting
application to his studies and urbanity of manners, obtained for him
a finished education and the esteem of his teachers and classmates.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
At the age of twenty, he entered upon the study of law in London,
where he ripened into manhood, and returned to his native state in
1764, with a rich and enduring fund of useful knowledge, prepared to
act well his part through future life.</p>

<p>The subject of American oppression by the British ministry was
freely discussed in England during his stay, and had prepared his
mind for the exciting crisis that awaited the colonies. In Charles
Carroll, of Carrollton, the friends of freedom and equal rights found
an unflinching and able advocate, and the enemies of liberty an uncompromising
but manly opposer. He possessed a clear head, a good
heart, and a discriminating mind. In action, he was cool and deliberate,
firm and decisive. As a lawyer, he was learned, lucid, and
logical; as a statesman, bold, discreet, and industrious; as a patriot,
pure, disinterested, and zealous; as a Christian, devoted, exemplary,
and consistent; and as a gentleman, urbane, accomplished, and courteous.
His talent for writing was also of a high order. This was
fully developed in 1772, in a controversy between the people and the
king’s governor, who had issued a proclamation derogatory to their
inalienable rights. In a series of communications published in the
public papers, Mr. Carroll boldly, ably, and triumphantly espoused
the people’s cause, answering conclusively and confuting completely
the combined arguments of the governor’s cabinet in favour of the
pretensions of their master. So fully were the people convinced by
the essays of Mr. Carroll that they were clearly right, that they hung
the proclamation upon a gallows, and bid defiance to the minions of
despotism. Before it was known who was the writer, the citizens of
Annapolis instructed their representatives to record a vote of thanks
to the author, and when they subsequently ascertained that Mr. Carroll
was the champion who had bearded the British lion, they repaired
in a body to his house, and made the welkin ring with heartfelt
thanks and plaudits of praise.</p>

<p>From that time forward he became a prominent leader of the liberal
party, an espouser of American rights, and a stern opposer of parliamentary
wrongs. His benign influence radiated its genial rays
upon the hearts, and confirmed the wavering minds of many in the
glorious cause of liberty. He went for his country and his whole
country. He portrayed, in bold and glowing colours, the oppressions
of the king, the corruptions and designs of his ministers, and the
humiliating consequences of tame submission to their arbitrary demands.
He was among the first to kindle the flame of patriotic resistance,
and light the torch of independence. He was among the
first to sanction the declaration of rights, and the last of that noble
band of patriots who signed this sacred instrument, that bid it a long,
a final farewell, and took his exit to “that country where the wicked
cease from troubling and the weary are at rest.”</p>

<p>On the 18th of July, 1776, he was elected to the convention of
Maryland, and on the 2nd of August following, took his seat in the
Continental Congress, and affixed his name to the chart of liberty.
His talents and zeal were highly appreciated by the members of that
august body. He had previously endeared himself to them by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
voluntary mission to Canada, in conjunction with the Rev. John Carroll,
Benjamin Franklin, and Samuel Chase. The object of this mission
was to persuade the people of Canada to unite with the colonies
in bursting the chains of slavery, and throw off the yoke of bondage
that had been forced upon them by the mother country. The Messrs.
Carrolls being of the Roman Catholic faith, then most prevalent
among the Canadians, and the other two gentlemen entertaining that
universal charity for others, that, if exercised at the present day,
would crumble to dust the sectarian walls of partition that are now
the greatest barriers against the advancement of the Redeemer’s kingdom,
it was fondly hoped that their influence might induce the people
of that country to join against the common enemy. The defeat and
death of Montgomery, and the dark prospects of future success,
caused them to determine on a contrary course. The consequences
of that course are at this time developing themselves most fearfully,
amidst the dying groans and streaming blood of the oppressed citizens
of Canada.</p>

<p>On his return from this mission, Mr. Carroll found, to his great
surprise, that the delegates from Maryland then in Congress, had
been instructed to vote against the declaration of independence. He
immediately repaired to the convention, and, by his eloquence and
cogent reasoning, convinced the members of their error, who immediately
rescinded the former and gave contrary instructions.</p>

<p>Although an active and efficient member of Congress, Mr. Carroll
occasionally returned to Maryland, and aided in the formation of its
constitution and laws. In 1778, he left the national legislature, and,
for several years, was a member of the senate of Maryland. From
1788 to 1791, he was a member of the United States’ senate, when
his services were again demanded by his native state, where he served
as a senator until 1801, when he retired from the great theatre of public
action, where he had acted a conspicuous and glorious part, that
stamped his name with unfading glory, his memory with lasting
gratitude and enduring fame.</p>

<p>In private life, Mr. Carroll lost none of the laurels that decked his
brow when in the service of his beloved country. Of an amiable and
kind disposition, he was highly esteemed by his friends and respected
by all. Temperate in all things his course was consistent, charitable,
and systematic. He was an exemplary Christian, and was ever opposed
to a spirit of persecution by one sect against another for opinion’s
sake. He was among the few who reason correctly and act
wisely upon this important subject. It is a fact, unknown perhaps
to many, and admitted by fewer still, that the Roman Catholics of
Maryland were the first who proposed and passed into a law religious
toleration in America. [See laws of the general assembly of that
state, 1647.] It is also a fact which is equally true, that the Protestants
were the first who introduced proscription, and obtained an
order from Charles II., after his restoration in 1661, to disfranchise
all Roman Catholics from holding any office, taking the loaves and
fishes exclusively into their own keeping, in violation of the charter
granted to Lord Baltimore by Charles I., and in violation of reason,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
common sense, and the laws of God. Sectarianism is not religion, nor
a child of heaven.</p>

<p>The Protestants having become the bride of state, and having the
power in their own hands, carried on their principles of proscription
under the authority of William III. The Roman Catholics were
taxed to support the religion of their oppressors, and by an act passed
in 1704, the celebration of mass or the instruction of youth by a Catholic,
insured him a transportation to England.</p>

<p>During the excitements produced by this unhallowed connection of
church and state, which several times resulted in bloodshed, the Carrolls
used their best exertions to produce a reconciliation between
the parties. This was never fully effected until the revolution compelled
all persuasions to unite in the common cause against the common
enemy.</p>

<p>For thirty years Mr. Carroll enjoyed the cheering comforts of
“sweet home,” and survived to hear the funeral knell of all the other
signers of the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>He enjoyed the rich reward of seeing the fruits of his labour, in
conjunction with his compatriots of the revolution, prospering under
the direction of an all wise Providence and a free and independent
people. He beheld, with increased delight, the onward march of his
favoured country, to which he had contributed largely in giving it a
name and character among the nations of the earth, at once admired
and respected.</p>

<p>He beheld, with increasing gratitude to Heaven, the asylum he had
aided in preparing for those whom the oppression of kings and tyrants
drive from their native shores. As one of the signers of the chart of
freemen, he stood alone, like a majestic oak that has long withstood
the raging tempest, calmly awaiting the time when he should be riven
and gathered to his fathers. Already had his mind ascended the
golden chain of faith, reaching from earth to Heaven: already had the
world lost its former charms; already had his mind become fixed on
scenes of future and purer bliss; already had he reached out his hand
to receive a crown of immortal glory; already had he anticipated the
joyful welcome he should receive from his Lord and Master; when,
on the 14th of November, 1832, his spirit was summoned from its
trembling, tottering tenement of clay to realms of joy beyond the
skies. Calm and resigned he entered Jordan’s flood; angels escorted
his soul to Immanuel’s happy shores, whilst his grateful country
mourned <em>deeply</em> and felt <em>strongly</em> the loss of one of her noblest sons
and purest patriots.</p>

<p>In the life of Charles Carroll, we have an example worthy the imitation
of youth, of manhood, of old age; of the lawyer, the statesman,
the patriot and the Christian. His career was guided by virtue and
prudence; his every action marked with honesty, frankness, and integrity;
richly meriting, and freely receiving the esteem and veneration
of a nation of <span class="smcap smaller">FREEMEN</span>.</p>

<p>Great designs require the deep consideration of strong and investigating
minds. Great events open a wide field for virtue and fame,
and bring to view powers of intellect, that, under ordinary circumstances,
would never unfold their beauties to mortal eyes. Hence
the brilliancy of talent that illuminated the glorious era of the American
revolution. Many who became eminent statesmen and renowned
heroes during that memorable struggle, in times of peace, would have
remained within the sphere of their particular occupations—lived retired
from the public gaze, and died without a full developement of
their mental powers. That many of the sages of that eventful period
were men of unusual talents and acquirements, I freely admit;
that the momentous transactions that engaged their attention served
to add a more vivid lustre to their names than the common routine
of life would have given them, is equally true. The perils that encompassed
them, the dangers that threatened them, the dark clouds
that hung over them, the noble patriotism that influenced them, and
the mighty work they conceived, planned, and consummated, all
combined to shed a sacred halo around them.</p>

<p>Among those whose natural desires did not lead them into the public
arena, was <span class="smcap">William Williams</span>, the son of the Rev. Solomon Williams,
D.&nbsp;D. He was a native of the town of Lebanon, Windham
county, Connecticut, and was born on the 8th of April, 1731. His
paternal ancestors were Welsh, one of whom immigrated from Wales
in 1630. They were remarkable for piety and a love of liberty. His
father was the highly esteemed and able pastor of the first congregational
church in Lebanon, during the long period of fifty-six years.
Deeply impressed with the importance of storing the youthful mind
with a good education, virtuous principles, and moral truth, he spared
no pains in furnishing his sons and daughters with the means of exploring
the fields of science. His own mind imbued with liberal
principles and expansive views, his children naturally imbibed the
same feelings. His own soul enraptured with the beauties of genuine
and practical piety, he desired and had the happiness to see his offspring,
one after another, consecrate themselves to the Lord of glory
by a public profession of the Christian faith. At an early age William
Williams became a member of the church over which his father presided,
and adorned his profession through life. After he had completed
his preparatory studies, he entered Harvard College and
graduated in 1751. He sustained a high reputation for correct deportment,
untiring industry, and scholastic lore. His father then
directed his theological studies in order that he might be prepared, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
so inclined, to enter the sacred desk. His talents were of a variegated
character, combining a taste for the classics, mechanics, architecture,
mathematics and general science.</p>

<p>Feeling an inclination to travel beyond the confines of his juvenile
perambulations, in 1755 he accepted a commission in the staff of Colonel
Ephraim Williams, a kinsman of his, and founder of the college
of that name at Williamstown, Massachusetts. A detachment, put
under the command of Colonel Williams, consisting of eleven hundred
men, was sent by Sir William Johnson, who commanded the
English troops, to reconnoitre the army under Baron Dieskau, composed
of a large body of French and Indians. After proceeding
about four miles, Colonel Williams was attacked by a superior force
lying in ambuscade. He commenced a spirited defence, but fell in the
early part of the action, bravely fighting for the mother country. The
detachment then fell back upon the main body in good order, which
advanced and repulsed the enemy.</p>

<p>The French war, in which the colonies were not interested, the acquirements
of which are still held by Great Britain, cost much American
blood and treasure. The pilgrim fathers were long treated and
used as mere vassals of the English crown. During that campaign,
William Williams became disgusted with the hauteur of the British
officers and with the manner they treated native Americans, who
were by far the most efficient in conducting the Indian mode of warfare.
Being ardent in his feelings and of a warm temperament, he
resolved never again to submit to their indignities, and returned
home and commenced the mercantile business.</p>

<p>Soon after, he was elected town clerk, a member of the assembly,
and appointed a justice of the peace. These were not solicited honours,
but awarded to him by his fellow citizens as the reward of merit.
Similar demonstrations of confidence were continued to him for more
than fifty years. For a long time he was either clerk or speaker of
the house of representatives in his native state, in which he served
nearly one hundred sessions.</p>

<p>When the revolutionary storm began to darken the horizon of public
tranquillity, Mr. Williams freely confronted its raging fury. He
was an able debater, an eloquent speaker, and a bold advocate of his
country’s rights. Extensively and favourably known, his influence
had a wide range. When the tocsin of war was finally sounded, he
closed his mercantile concerns and devoted his whole time to the glorious
cause of equal rights and rational liberty. His learning, piety,
experience in public affairs, honesty of purpose, and energy of action,
combined to give great weight to his character. He was an active
member of the council of safety, and on the second Thursday in October,
1775, was appointed a representative of the Continental Congress.
He entered zealously into the deliberations of that revered
body, and became prominent and useful. He was ever ready to go
as far as any one in promoting the liberation of his bleeding country
from the serpentine coils of oppressive tyranny. He was in favour of
bold and vigorous measures, and advocated the declaration of rights
from its incipient conception to its final adoption. He was instrumental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
in removing the timidity and wavering doubts of many, whose
motives and desires were as pure, but whose moral courage was less
than his. Whenever he rose in debate he was listened to with profound
attention. He possessed a fine figure of the middle size, dark
hair, piercing black eyes, an aqueline nose, an open and ingenuous
countenance, and a stentorian voice, combined with a clear head, a
Roman heart, a sound judgment, an acute perception, and a logical
mind. He was well versed in the principles of international law, the
different forms of government and the duties of legislation.</p>

<p>He was re-elected to Congress the two succeeding years, and when
the final vote upon the charter of our rights was taken, the voice of
William Williams responded a thundering—“<span class="smcap">Aye</span>”—that told his
boldness and his zeal. That vote stands confirmed by his signature
upon the record of immortal fame, a proud memento of his unalloyed
patriotism, a conclusive proof of his moral firmness.</p>

<p>He was free from an aspiring ambition based on self and nurtured
by intrigue. From the pure fountain of an honest heart his motives
emanated; to promote the glory of his country was his anxious desire.
Upon the altar of liberty he was willing to sacrifice his property and
his life; in vindicating the cause of freedom he was willing to spend
his latest breath. Honesty of purpose, self-devotion, and persevering
action were among his marked characteristics. To rouse his countrymen
to a sense of danger, and to induce them to enlist in the common
cause against the common enemy, he used every honourable
exertion.</p>

<p>Just before Congress was compelled to fly before the victorious foe
from Philadelphia, Mr. Williams, at the risk of being captured himself,
rescued his colleague, Colonel Dyer, from the fangs of the British,
who had planned and were on the point of effecting his arrest.
They both made a hair-breadth escape.</p>

<p>When the government treasury was drained of its last hard dollar,
this patriot threw in what he termed his “mite” of specie, amounting
to more than two thousand dollars, and took continental money in return,
which soon died in his hands. In the cause of equal rights his
property was nearly all expended, and he gloried in being able to add
to his mental aid a portion of “the sinews of power.”</p>

<p>For forty years he was a judge of probate, a select-man of his native
town during the war, commissioner of the public school fund, and
held almost every office within the gift of his constituents, discharging
the duties of all with so much industry, ability and integrity, that
slander found no crevice in his uninterrupted and unblemished reputation
for the smallest entering wedge, by which to impugn his private
or public character. He was remarkably active and fortunate
in obtaining private donations of necessaries to supply the army. He
went from house to house among his friends, obtaining small parcels
of any and every article that would alleviate the wants of the destitute
soldiers. He forwarded to them at different times more than a
thousand blankets. During the winter of 1781, he gave up his own
house for the accommodation of the officers of the legion under Colonel
Laurens, and used every effort to render them comfortable. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
industry was equal to his patriotism, seldom retiring until after twelve
at night, and rising at early dawn.</p>

<p>He was a member of the convention of his state when the federal
constitution was adopted, and was a warm advocate for that instrument.
He was never permitted to enjoy full retirement from public
service until disabled by disease, which terminated his useful career
on the 2nd of August, 1811. He had lived the life of a good man, his
last end was peaceful, calm and happy. During his last years he was
considerably deaf, and spent much time in Christian devotion. But
few men have served their country as much, and no one more faithfully
than did <span class="smcap">William Williams</span>.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_30">SAMUEL HUNTINGTON.</h2>
</div>

<p>No quality of the human mind sheds over it more lustre than consistency.
“Be consistent,” was a Roman motto, and once a Roman
virtue that influenced the hearts and actions of its republican sages,
heroes, and literati. Consistency is one of the brightest jewels in
the escutcheon of a name. It is the crowning glory of meritorious
fame, and implies a course of life that ennobles and dignifies man.
It is based upon true wisdom and sound discretion, the pilot and
helm of the bark of life in navigating the ocean of time. Without it,
the buffetings of chaos, the sand-bars of folly, and the rocks of disaster,
cannot be avoided. Without it, the brightness of other talents
and attainments of a high order are often eclipsed by the clouds of
error and obscured by the mists of ridicule. With it, mediocrity
shines and enables the plough-boy of the field to reach the pinnacle
of substantial and enduring fame, when his classic friend who has no
share in consistency, but is in all other respects his superior, sinks
into oblivion.</p>

<p>It is a propensity susceptible of cultivation, and where its developements
are small in youth, parents and instructors should nurture
it with great attention and peculiar care. It is of more importance
than classic lore and the most powerful elocution. Dr. Young has
truly said, “With the talents of an angel a man may be a fool.” The
sages of the American revolution were remarkable for consistency.
Many of them rose from the humble walks of life by the force of their
own exertions, guided by this darling attribute, and became eminently
useful in the cause of liberty.</p>

<p>Among this class the name of <span class="smcap">Samuel Huntington</span> stands conspicuous.
He was a native of Windham, Connecticut, born on the 2nd
of July, 1732. His father, Nathaniel Huntington, was a plain honest
farmer, and gave this son only a common English education.
Three of his brothers enjoyed the advantages of Yale College and
became gospel ministers, all of them adorning their profession, and
one of them, Joseph, becoming an eminent divine and an able writer.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Their pious mother was the happy instrument that led them to the
pure font of religion, and had the happiness to see her numerous offspring
all walking hand in hand in the ways of wisdom and virtue.
Samuel followed the plough until he was twenty-two years of age.
He was of middle stature, dark complexion, keen eyes, countenance
expressive, with a deportment that commanded respect, love and
esteem. He was remarkable for industry and integrity, and from
his early youth had been a close observer of men and things, and an
attentive reader. His native talents were strong and of a grave cast,
his judgment was clear and his reflections deep. From his childhood
to his grave he was remarkable for consistency in all things.
This was his strong forte, and exalted him to a lofty eminence. In
his twenty-third year he commenced reading law at his father’s domicile,
from books loaned to him by Zedediah Elderkin, Esq. a member
of the Norwich bar. Like Roger Sherman, he soon mastered the
elementary principles of that intricate science, was admitted to the
practical honours of the profession, and immediately opened an office
in his native town. His reputation as an honest man, possessing a
clear head and a good heart, already rested on a firm basis. His
fame as an able advocate and safe counsellor, soon added new grace
to this superstructure. He was not celebrated for Ciceronean powers;
he imitated more closely Socrates and Solon. His manner was
plain and unvarnished, but marked by that deep sincerity and candour
that seldom fail to impress the minds of a court and jury favourably,
and often foil the most brilliant and happy displays of
Demosthenean eloquence. To his other strong qualities he added
punctuality, which is the very life of business. He soon obtained a
lucrative practice and the confidence of the community. In 1760, he
removed to Norwich, where a wider field was open before him; and
two years after, he emerged from the lonely regions of celibacy with
Martha, the accomplished daughter of Ebenezer Devotion, and entered
the delightful bowers of matrimony, thus giving him an importance
in society that, single blessedness never confers. The choice he made
was consistent; his partner proved to be an amiable companion,
uniting the accomplishments of a lady and the piety of a Christian,
with laudable industry and strict economy. “Marriage, with peace, is
this world’s paradise.”</p>

<p>The professional fame of Mr. Huntington continued to rise and expand,
and when the all-important subject of American rights and
British wrongs was agitated, he exerted his extensive influence and
noblest powers in favour of the cause of equal rights. In 1764, he
was elected to the general assembly, and the next year was appointed
king’s attorney, the duties of which office he continued to ably
discharge until the pestiferous atmosphere of monarchial oppression
drove him from under the dark mantle of a corrupt and impolitic
ministry. He was appointed to the bench of the Superior Court in
1774, and the next year a member of the council of his native state.
In October, 1775, he had the honour of being associated with the patriots
and sages of the Continental Congress then assembled at Philadelphia,
of which body he became a prominent and useful member.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
In January following he again took his seat in that venerable assembly,
and advocated boldly, fearlessly, and with undisguised sincerity,
the necessity of severing, at one gigantic stroke, the cords that
bound the colonies to England. The solemnity of his manners, the
deep tone of his reasoning, the lucid demonstration of his propositions,
and the purity of his patriotism, were well calculated to carry
conviction to the heart and impart confidence to the wavering and
timid. He was present on the memorable 4th of July, 1776, at the
birth of our independence, and became a subscribing witness to the
imposing solemnities of that eventful day. He was continued a member
of Congress until 1781, when ill health compelled him to retire,
for a season, from the halls of legislation.</p>

<p>He was a man of great industry, clearness of perception, honesty
of purpose, and profound research; united with an extensive practical
knowledge of human nature, general business, and political economy,
which rendered him worthy of unlimited confidence and gave
him a place on the most important committees. So highly was Mr.
Huntington esteemed, that on the resignation of Mr. Jay, in 1779,
who was appointed minister to Europe, he was elected president of
Congress, the duties of which high and dignified station he discharged
with so much consistency and ability, that on his final resignation in
July 1781, that august body passed and communicated to him a vote
of thanks for the able manner he had filled the chair and promoted
the execution of public business. So anxious were the members that
he should resume his seat, that they waited considerable time before
they supplied the vacancy permanently, hoping that his health might
be restored and enable him to return. During this interim of his
congressional career, when he was able, he served his own state on
the bench and in her council. In 1783, he resumed his seat in the
national legislature, during which year he closed his services in that
body and declined a re-election. He had aided in completing the
mighty work of national freedom; the star spangled banner was floating
in the breeze of liberty; his country had triumphed over a merciless
foe; her political regeneration had been consummated; America
was disenthralled; he then desired retirement from the arena of public
life. His rest was of brief duration. In 1784, he was appointed
chief justice of his native state; the ensuing year, lieutenant-governor;
and the year following that, he was elected governor of Connecticut,
which responsible and important office he filled until the 5th day of
January, 1796, when he sunk under a complication of diseases, and
closed his eyes in death. He died the death of a righteous man, having
long adorned the profession of religion by a life of consistent and
exemplary piety.</p>

<p>In the life of this good and useful patriot, we find much to admire
and nothing to condemn. His superior virtues and uniform consistency
eclipsed every frailty of his nature. In the performance of all
the duties of public and private life, he was a model worthy of the
highest praise and of the closest imitation. From the plough in the
field, through his bright career to the presidential chair in Congress,
and from thence to the chief magistracy of his native state, so great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
were his consistency, wisdom, prudence, discretion, and even-handed
justice, that envy, malice, and slander, shrunk from the torpedo touch
of his moral purity. As a lawyer, a judge, a statesman, and a chief
magistrate, he stood admired, approved, and honoured. He was a
stranger to pomp and show; republican in his manners as well as in
his principles; temperate and frugal in his habits; scrupulously honest
in the discharge of every duty; calm and deliberate in all his actions;
urbane and affable in his intercourse with mankind; completely master
of all his passions; systematic and punctual in private and public
business; emphatically a son of consistency, liberty, order, and law.
His fame is based upon substantial merit; his name is surrounded by
a sacred halo that renders it dear to every freeman; his examples
will shed a salutary influence over the mind of every reader capable
of receiving the congenial impression of angelic consistency.</p>

<hr />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_31">GEORGE WALTON.</h2>
</div>

<p>Knowledge is the treasure of the mind; virtue is the parent of
earthly happiness. In this enlightened age and in our free country,
ignorance is a voluntary misfortune arising from idleness, the parent
of want, vice, and shame. Under the benevolent arrangements of the
present day, every child, youth, woman and man can have access to
books, and generally to schools. At no era of the world has the mantle
of science been so widely spread as at this time. All who will
may drink at the pure fountain of intelligence, and go on their way
rejoicing in light. By a proper improvement of time, the apprentice
of the workshop may lay in a stock of useful information that will
enable him, when he arrives at manhood, to take a respectable stand
by the side of those who have been illumined with the full blaze of a
collegiate education. In his own hands are the materials of future
fame, oblivial obscurity, or shameless infamy. He is the architect of
his own fortune, and will rise in the scale of being just in proportion
with his mental exertions. Youth of America, if you desire to remain
free, store your minds with knowledge. Several bright examples
have already been spread before the reader, in this review of the
lives of the signers of the declaration, of men who raised themselves
by the force of their own powers and industry to the loftiest pinnacle
of enduring fame.</p>

<p>In tracing the career of <span class="smcap">George Walton</span>, another instance of the
same kind is presented. He was a native of Frederic county, Virginia,
born in 1740. Without any school education he was apprenticed
to a morose carpenter at an early age, who was so penurious
as to deny him a candle to read by, after having faithfully performed
his task of labour. So great was his desire to become familiar
with books, that he would collect pine knots, which afforded him
the only light for the prosecution of his studies during his boyhood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
and youth. He served out his time in strict accordance with his
indentures, and when manhood dawned upon him, his mind was
stored with a rich stock of useful intelligence and practical information.
This he had acquired alone by the dint of industry during
those hours of the night when a large proportion of other boys and
youth were either reposing in slumber, or were wasting their time in
corrupt and vicious company, demonstrating most clearly <em>that ignorance
is a voluntary misfortune</em>.</p>

<p>When he arrived at his majority he went to Georgia and commenced
the study of law with Henry Young, Esq., under whose instruction
he rapidly acquired the elements of the profession, and was
admitted to the bar in 1774. During his investigation of the principles
laid down by Blackstone and other able writers, he was most
forcibly struck with the gross violation of the chartered and constitutional
rights of the colonies. His indignation became roused, he communicated
his views and feelings to other kindred spirits, and was
among the first to oppose British oppression in his adopted state.
The interests of the crown were sustained in Georgia longer than in
either of the other provinces. A temporizing spirit pervaded the
minds of many of those who desired liberty, but believed its attainment
beyond their reach. For some time they preferred enduring
their present sufferings, lest a severer fate should overtake them.
They knew their own weakness, they dreaded the physical power of
England. But George Walton and a few other bold patriots were
not to be intimidated by a display of military force. They considered
that to die in the cause of liberty was more glorious than to wear the
chains of a tyrant. They were determined never to bow the knee to
Baal, or offer a sacrifice at the altar of monarchy. They resolved
to be free or nobly perish in the attempt.</p>

<p>In order to test the public mind, Messrs. Walton, Noble, Bullock,
and Houston, over their proper signatures, published a notice for a
meeting of their fellow citizens to be held at the Liberty Pole, Tondee’s
tavern, Savannah, on the 27th of July, 1774, in order to take
into consideration the constitutional rights and liberties of the American
subjects of the British empire. This was the first liberty pole
planted in that state; this was the first meeting that put the revolutionary
ball in motion in Georgia. A large number of citizens assembled
at the time and place appointed, and were eloquently addressed
by Mr. Walton, who, from that time, became a prominent
and able leader of the popular party. A committee was organized
for the purpose of rousing the people to a sense of impending danger
and to a vindication of their injured rights. Governor Wright, with
the hireling phalanx of the crown, used great exertions to obtain from
the inhabitants of every parish a written pledge to sustain them in
executing the nefarious designs of the mother country, and to submit
their necks more implicitly to the yoke of bondage. Fascinating
promises of redress were held out, and the people were in a measure
lulled into quietness by a renewal of their petitions to the throne for
the repeal of the unconstitutional laws of parliament. But the fire of
patriotism had commenced its insulating course. From Mr. Walton
and his compatriots its holy flame continued to spread from heart to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
heart, from sire to son, from parish to parish, at first slowly, but
finally illuminating the horizon of liberty with cheering refulgence.
The struggle of many of the more timid patriots in that province,
between policy and duty, was long suspended on the pivot of indecision.
Present self-interest and self-preservation influenced many
to remain inactive for a season, who subsequently became the bold
advocates of liberal principles. In January, 1775, the members of the
assembly were so equally divided upon the all-important subject of
the revolution, then rolling upon them, that they adjourned without
any definite action relative to it. The same wavering spirit was
manifested at the public meetings and by the committee of safety.
To restore the public mind from this political paralysis, was the province
of Mr. Walton and a few other noble spirits. All the other
colonies had united in the common cause against the common enemy
and had sent delegates to the Congress convened at Philadelphia the
previous year. That Georgia should be the last to hug the chains
and kiss the rod of oppression, was to him a source of mortification
and regret. But he determined not to desert his post. His exertions
became equal to the herculean task before. His powers of mind rose
with the magnitude of the occasion; his eloquence and logic bore down
all opposition, and when the cry of blood—of murder—from the heights
of Lexington was heard, the people started from their reverie, rose in
the majesty of their might, buckled on the armour of opposition,
burst the cords that bound them, and bid defiance to British power.
In May, 1775, the parish of St. Johns sent Lyman Hall to the Continental
Congress, and in July, a convention of the province sanctioned
his election, joined the confederacy, and sent four other delegates to
aid him. The council of safety was re-organized, and vigorous measures
adopted to aid the cause of rational liberty. In these measures
Mr. Walton was one of the leading men. In January of the next
year the legislature appointed Mr. Bullock, a bold and active patriot,
president of the executive council by a large majority. British authority
was at an end. Governor Wright threatened the members
with bayonets, the next hour he was their prisoner, and permitted
only the liberty of his own house on his parol of honour. This he
violated, fled on board of the armed fleet in the harbour, commenced
an attack upon the town, was shamefully defeated, and retired from
the vengeance of an enraged, insulted, and injured populace.</p>

<p>In February, 1776, Mr. Walton was elected to Congress, and
entered upon the important duties of legislation. He at once took his
seat and proved a bold, energetic, and efficient advocate for every
measure calculated to advance the cause of independence. He warmly
supported the declaration of rights and most cheerfully gave it his vote
and signature. He continued to be annually elected a member of
the national legislature until 1781, excepting 1779, when he was
governor of Georgia, he rendered essential service on various committees.
When Congress was compelled to retire to Baltimore on
the 13th of December, 1776, in consequence of the approach of the
British army, Messrs. Morris, Clymer, and Walton, were left as a
committee of superintendence with $200,000, to be expended for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
use of the army. Mr. Walton was also a member of the treasury
board and marine committee, and ably discharged every duty that
devolved upon him. In addition to his civil honours, his brow was
decked with the epic wreath. In 1778, he was commissioned colonel
of militia, and bravely sustained himself at the battle of Savannah
between the American troops under General Howe and the British
under Colonel Campbell. The battalion under his command made a
desperate resistance until he received a shot in his thigh, fell from his
horse, and was captured by the enemy. So long as his wound confined
him he was held under a parol of honour; when he recovered,
he was sent to Sunbury and confined with the other prisoners. He
was soon after exchanged, and again entered into the service of Congress,
having been absent during the session of 1778. In January,
1783, he was appointed chief justice of Georgia. He was subsequently
again elected governor of the state, and also a member of the
United States senate, and served several sessions in the state legislature.
He was a judge of the superior court, when he closed his
laborious life on the 2nd of February, 1803, which had been almost
entirely devoted to the service of his country. He was also one of
the commissioners that effected a treaty with the Cherokee Indians
in Tennessee. His high reputation as an able and faithful public servant,
imposed upon him numerous and onerous duties, all of which
he discharged in a manner that did honour to his name and his country.
The only difficulty in which he appears to have been involved
during his public career, was as singular as it proved harmless, and
lost none of its odd features in its final adjustment. During the war,
a jealousy existed between the civil and military powers in Georgia.
At the head of the first was Mr. Walton; at the head of the latter,
General M’Intosh. In 1779, when the former was first elected
governor of the state, a forged letter, purporting to be from the legislature,
then in session at Savannah, was forwarded to Congress, requesting
the removal of the latter to some other field of action. The
governor was charged with a knowledge of the transaction; but few,
if any, believed it, and he declared himself ignorant of the whole
matter. The documentary proofs were laid before the house in
January, 1783, and whilst under discussion, Mr. Walton was appointed
chief justice of the state; the next day a vote of censure was
passed upon him for participating in the forged letter, and the attorney-general
directed to institute proceedings against him in the very
court over which he presided, and the only one that had cognisance
of the charge against him. The vote of censure may have healed the
wounded feelings of General M’Intosh; it certainly never injured
chief justice Walton, and was never afterwards agitated. It was
more like a political compromise of the present day than any revolutionary
farce that has come under my notice.</p>

<p>During the latter part of his life, Judge Walton confined his public
duties to the bench of the superior court; and during the intervals of
its session, enjoyed the comforts of domestic life with his family, consisting
of one son, and his amiable and accomplished companion, the
daughter of Mr. Chamber, whom he had married in 1777. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
not wealthy, was free from avarice, and was contented with a competence
which was afforded by his public emoluments and the produce
of a small plantation. He indulged in good living, and suffered
much from the gout at various times. He was a close student during
his whole life. He continued to add to his experience a general knowledge
of the sciences, and became an ornament to the judiciary of his
state. He was also a ready writer, and possessed a peculiar talent
for satire, which he occasionally resorted to as a correction of error
and folly. He was of a warm temperament, easily excited, resenting
every indignity, but highly honourable and just, moving within the
orbit of propriety under all circumstances, showing clearly that the
inflammable passions may be governed and controlled by a wise discretion.
He was open and frank, a stranger to disguise, ardent in his
attachments, firm in his purposes, stern and reserve in his manners
in general society, but very familiar in the private circle with his
friends. He was an indignant but manly opponent; his enemies knew
just where to find him. He was fond of brevity and despatch in conversation
and in business, and systematic in all his proceedings and
arrangements both public and private. Taken as a whole, he was
one of the most useful men of his day and generation, and has left
examples worthy of the imitation of the apprentice, the student, the
lawyer, the judge, the magistrate, and the statesman. By the force
of industry and perseverance he rose from the humblest walks of
life to the most dignified stations in the community. Let every youth
whose eyes meet this brief sketch, be stimulated to embrace every
opportunity for improvement, and drink often and freely at the crystal
fountain of knowledge now accessible and open to all. Soon the
affairs of a mighty nation will devolve upon you; without intelligence
you cannot be prepared to guard its dearest interests and counteract
the corrupting and baneful evils that are often put in motion by wild
ambition, sordid selfishness, and dark intrigue.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_32">GEORGE CLYMER.</h2>
</div>

<p>The mental powers of man are as diversified as the soils of the
earth. Upon the minds of some we pour the classic stream in vain;
like the desert of Sahara, they are barren of fruit or flower. Upon
the minds of others, laborious efforts produce an improvement, but
never enrich them. Their substance is too light and their substratum
too porous to long retain the fructifying substances lavished upon
them. Others, by good culture, yield a liberal harvest and become
valuable by use. Others again, like the alluvial prairie, are adorned
with spontaneous fruits, and only require the introduction of seed to
afford all the rich varieties that may be desired. Expose them to the
genial rays of the sun of science and the germs of genius will immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
spring up, the embryo forms will bud and blossom like the
rose.</p>

<p>The mind of <span class="smcap">George Clymer</span> was composed of a prolific and
deep mould, capable of producing the richest foliage. Fortunately for
our country, it was not appropriated entirely to ornamental flowers
and blooming shrubbery, but to the substantial fruits that invigorate
and support life.</p>

<p>He was born in Philadelphia in 1739. His father removed from
Bristol, England, to that city, and died when this son was but seven
years of age. George Clymer was then taken under the guardian care
of William Coleman, his uncle, who treated him as a son and made
him heir of most of his property. Himself a literary man, Mr. Coleman
conferred upon his nephew a good education. He possessed a
splendid library, and had the gratifying consolation of seeing it often
and fully explored by George Clymer, who manifested an early taste
for reading, and investigated critically every subject that came before
him, never leaving it until he traced it through all its meanderings to
its primeval source. This trait in his character rendered him vastly
useful in the momentous concerns that occupied his subsequent life.
It is of the first importance to dig deep and lay firmly the foundations
of an education, that the superstructure may rest upon a substantial
basis.</p>

<p>From the seminary, Mr. Clymer went into the counting-house of
his uncle, and made himself acquainted with the mercantile business,
in which he subsequently embarked. The precariousness and uncertainty
of this calling rendered it unpleasant to him. He was opposed
to sudden gains or losses, because the one was calculated to
elate the mind too much, and the other to depress it too low, thus
destroying the equilibrium calculated to impart the most happiness
to a man and render him most useful to himself, to his family, and to
the community. He contended that a virtuous equality in life is
more conducive to the comfort and prosperity of a nation, than to
have a majority of the wealth wielded by a favoured few. He was
the friend of equal rights and free principles. He was a republican
of the Roman school, a patriot of the highest order, a philanthropist
of the noblest cast, and opposed to all monopolies. His genius was
of that original order, that, like some comets, illuminate our world
only at long intervals. It seemed to traverse the circuit of human
nature, of metaphysics, of philosophy, and of general science, without
an apparent effort, drawing from each conclusions peculiarly its own.
He was a virtuoso, an amateur, and at the same time a deep logician
and mathematician. A love of liberty and equal rights was with him
an innate quality. His mind was richly stored with the history of
other times and nations; he was well versed in the principles of law
and government, and understood well the chartered rights of his country,
and felt most keenly the increasing infringements upon them by
the very power that was bound by the laws of nature, of man, and of
God, to protect them. His course at the commencement of the revolution
can readily be imagined. True, his entire property was vested
in commercial business; Reese Meredith, his father-in-law, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
his partner in trade, and for him to oppose the interests of the crown,
seemed certain destruction to his own, so far as pecuniary matters
were concerned. But his mind moved in an orbit limited only by the
confines of freedom. He was among the first to resist the oppressors
of his country and proclaim to his fellow citizens the principles of
liberty. At the “<em>tea meeting</em>,” held by the citizens of Philadelphia
on the 16th of October, 1773, his reasoning, sincerity, zeal and enthusiastic
patriotism, commanded great attention and admiration.
Free from pedantry and naturally retiring his powers of mind were
known only to his friends. From that time they were claimed as
public property. He was compelled to surrender possession to the
rightful owners, without certiorari or appeal, and was engaged in all
the important measures of the day. When the final crisis arrived for
action; when forbearance had ceased to be a virtue; when the war-cry
resounded from the heights of Lexington, Mr. Clymer took command
of a company under General Cadwalader and repaired to the
tented field. He was at the same time a member of the council of
safety, and had served on all or most of the preliminary committees
of his native city appointed to prepare petitions, remonstrances and
measures of defence. He was soon called from the field of epic glory,
and appointed by Congress, on the 29th of July, 1775, in conjunction
with Michael Hillegas, to take charge of the public treasury. He
subscribed liberally to the loan raised for the public service, and
poured all the specie he could raise into the government chest and
took in return paper, which was virtually ephemeral in its value.
His examples and his patriotic enthusiasm had a powerful influence
upon his friends, many of whom came boldly to the rescue. In July,
1776, he took his seat in the Continental Congress <em>after</em> the adoption
of the declaration of rights, to which he most cheerfully subscribed.
A part of the preceding delegation from Pennsylvania when they
found their colleagues were in favour of cutting loose, left their station
and retired, perhaps that they might avoid the wrath of the king
on the one hand and the indignation of the patriots on the other, or
believing the time had not yet arrived for so bold a step. The people
promptly filled their places with men who <em>dared</em> to be free, by
men who had already nobly resolved on <em>liberty</em> or <em>death</em>.</p>

<p>In September of that year, Messrs. Clymer and Stockton were sent
by Congress to regulate the northern army and to confer with Washington
in making arrangements for future action. In December of
the same year Congress retired to Baltimore in consequence of the
threatened approach of the British army, then spreading consternation,
destruction and death through New Jersey. Mr. Clymer was
one of the committee left in Philadelphia to superintend the public
interests and brave the perils that were rolling onward like a tornado.
He was faithful in the discharge of every duty, devoting his
time and fortune to the advancement of the glorious cause he had
espoused. He was returned to Congress the next year, and in April
was again appointed upon a committee to repair to the army and confer
with Washington upon all subjects that required their attention,
which were neither few nor small. In the autumn of that year an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
additional momentum was given to the patriotism of Mr. Clymer.
He had removed his family and goods to Chester county, and immediately
after the defeat of the Americans at Brandywine, the tories
led the British to his house; his family escaped, but his property, to
a large amount, was totally destroyed. This sacrifice at the altar of
freedom seemed to strengthen his political faith and impart fresh vigour
to his exertions.</p>

<p>In December, 1779, he was one of a board of commissioners sent
by Congress to Fort Pitt, to counteract, if possible, the hostility of
the savages, who were committing murders upon the western frontiers
of Virginia and Pennsylvania, and to effect, if practicable, a treaty
with the several tribes, and if unsuccessful in the accomplishment of
these designs, to make arrangements for offensive operations. The
mission was boldly executed, principally by Mr. Clymer alone, who
narrowly escaped the tomahawk during his absence. The commissioners
returned in April and reported the necessity of carrying the
war into the Indian country. During the next year Mr. Clymer
was not in Congress, but devoted his time in raising loans and supplies
for the army, then destitute of almost every necessary of life and
of the munitions of war. In 1780, he was again elected to the national
legislature and served until November of the ensuing year,
when he and John Nixon were appointed to organize the Bank of
North America, which was instrumental in reviving the prostrate credit
of the government. In May, 1782, he was associated with Mr.
Rutledge on a mission through the southern states, for the purpose of
inducing them to meet more promptly the requisitions of Congress
for supplies. During the entire period of the revolution he devoted
his whole time to the service of his country, and discharged every
duty assigned him to the entire satisfaction of his constituents and
colleagues. He stood high as an able and faithful co-worker in the
vineyard of liberty, and retired from the field when the harvest was
ended covered with the honours of enduring fame. At the close of
the war he removed to Princeton, for the purpose of resting from his
toils and educating his children. The ensuing year his services were
requested in his native state, and he returned to Philadelphia. He
was elected to the Pennsylvania legislature, and contributed largely
in divesting her old constitution and laws of the obnoxious branches
of tyranny that were still attached to them. He introduced the amelioration
of the penal code and was the originator and warm advocate
of abolishing death in all cases, except murder in the first degree.
He was the father of the much admired penitentiary system of that
state, which has but recently been organized fully upon the plan
proposed by him—that of solitary confinement at hard labour. It may
not be known to the young reader, that in former times, prisoners,
after conviction, were compelled to labour in chains often in the most
public places. The superiority of solitary confinement over all other
modes of punishment has been fully demonstrated, and is in a course
of adoption throughout the civilized world. The arguments of Mr.
Clymer in favour of these philanthropic measures manifested a deep
and thorough knowledge of human nature, and were based upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
firm pillars of equal justice, lucid reason and sound policy. He
devised and prepared the humane report of the committee that remodelled
the penal code of Pennsylvania, which has been fully and successfully
tested, and stands an admired monument of judicial reformation,
and an enduring praise to the name of its author.</p>

<p>The mind of Mr. Clymer was peculiarly prolific and happy in the
conception of plans of usefulness and utility. To benefit his country
and better the condition of mankind, afforded him the highest pleasure.
To effect this, he saw the necessity of reducing every department
of government to system and order. American independence
was achieved; to preserve it by reducing to harmony the conflicting
local interests, jealousies and inconsiderate clamours of the malevolent,
was an herculean task yet to be performed. The convention that
formed the federal constitution was therefore hailed with joy by Mr.
Clymer, who was one of its members. The result of the labours of
that body was fraught with deeper interest than the war struggle for
victory over a foreign foe. It involved the fate of our infant republic,
which was then verging on dissolution and fast retrograding towards
the awful gulf of primeval chaos. The conflict was between members
of the same family, and required the deepest sagacity, the profoundest
wisdom, the most acute judgment, the most disinterested patriotism,
the most exalted charity, and the purest spirit of conciliation, to bring
it to a peaceful and satisfactory termination. Happily for our country
this was done, and Mr. Clymer contributed his full share in the
accomplishment of the glorious work.</p>

<p>He was elected a member of the first Congress convened under that
saving instrument, he was a stern republican and opposed to tacking
any titles to the name of any public man except that of his office.
Excellency, honourable, &amp;c., he conceived to be the mere shadows of
a shadow, too vain and trifling for a freeman. He was opposed to the
right of instruction from his constituents, because they must necessarily
decide without hearing either evidence or argument. He was
unwilling to be made a mere passive machine of puerile power, a mere
automaton of party spirit.</p>

<p>In the organization of the general government through all its ramifications
he took a deep interest and an active part. Every subject
that was presented to Congress for consideration he analyzed with the
skill of a sage, a statesman and a philosopher. In 1790, he closed
his legislative career and declined again entering upon its arduous
duties. Under the act of Congress of 1791, imposing a duty on domestic
distilled spirits, Mr. Clymer was appointed to superintend its
collection in his own state. The tax was then called, by way of opprobrium,
the <em>excise</em>. This law gave great dissatisfaction in many
places, and in Pennsylvania produced what was termed the <em>whiskey
rebellion</em>, which required the military to restore order. Unpleasant
as it was, Mr. Clymer proceeded to perform his duty by appointing
the required collectors in each county, endeavouring to persuade the
people to submit to the law whilst in force, and pursue the constitutional
remedy for its repeal if they believed it wrong. During the height of
the excitement he hazarded his life among the malecontents where but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
few other men would have been spared if clothed with the same office.
He finally resigned this station, and was soon after appointed a commissioner,
with Colonels Pickens and Hawkins, to negociate a treaty
with the Cherokee and Creek Indians in Georgia, which was effected
on the 29th of June, 1796, and closed his long, faithful and arduous
public career. He had perilled his life, his fortune and his sacred
honour for his country; he had been her unyielding and fearless advocate
amidst the storms of revolution, civil discord and open rebellion;
he now saw her peaceful, prosperous and happy, with the illustrious
Washington presiding over her destinies. He could therefore
retire to enjoy the fruits of his labours and his toils, without any to
disturb or make him afraid.</p>

<p>But he remained an active man during his whole life. He felt an
interest in every kind of improvement, and to many he extended a
fostering care. As early as 1785, he aided in establishing the Philadelphia
Agricultural Society, and when the Academy of Fine Arts
was founded in that city he was one of its liberal patrons. He aided
also in establishing the Philadelphia Bank. Of the former, he was
vice president, and of the two latter, president when he died. He
was a friend to all the labouring classes, and made himself acquainted
with the principles of farming and the mechanic trades. His private
papers exhibit a great variety of draughts and plans of bridges, canals,
water-works, machinery and implements of husbandry, and numerous
recipes relative to the arts. Like the philosophic Franklin, he extended
his researches to almost every subject within the grasp of man,
and treasured in his mind the essential oil of each. He always sought
for solid substance that could be applied to substantial use. His mind
and his manners were opposed to pedantry and pomp. He was what,
in common parlance, would now be called a plain, old fashioned, blunt
man. His bluntness was not of an offensive kind; it consisted in laconic
truth, dressed in republican simplicity, a garb that was much
admired during the times of pure unsophisticated patriotism. Although
he originated many important measures in the national and
state legislature, he seldom spoke in the forum, and was often unknown
to the public as such, when the author of the most salutary
propositions. He was ambitious only to do good, and was not
anxious that his name should be wafted on the breeze of popular applause
or be emblazoned in the high places of the earth. To know that
he had been instrumental in benefitting the human family was the ultimatum
of his soul. When the importance of a subject induced him
to rise in debate he was listened to with profound attention, and was
an example worthy of imitation. Without any pretensions to refined
elocution, he expressed in strong language the sentiments he strongly
felt. He came directly to the point, adhered closely to it in a strain
of keen, cutting, pithy and laconic reasoning; was always brief, often
casting into the shade, by his remarks of a few moments, the laboured
and gaudy speeches of his opponents that had cost them weeks to prepare
and hours to deliver. He effected this, not by personal recrimination
or irony, but by aiming his blows at the strong points, the syllabus
of their superstructure, which he often demolished at one bold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
stroke with the damask blade of sound logic, drawn from the scabbard
of plain common sense, and wielded by the vigorous arm of lucid reason.
He was opposed to every shade of aristocracy and every thing
anti-republican, both in theory and practice. His views were broad
and liberal, his purposes were honest and patriotic. He was an attentive
reader, and wrote numerous essays, which are forcible, logical,
and extremely sarcastic.</p>

<p>In the private walks of life his character was a model of human
excellence. All its relations he discharged with the most scrupulous
fidelity and integrity. He was proverbial for punctuality in all things,
if only to take a walk with a friend or present a promised toy to a
child. In conversation he was agreeable and instructive, illuminating
and enlivening the social circle with apothegms, aphorisms, and pungent
anecdotes, imparting pleasure and intelligence to all around him.
In all this he was modest, chaste and discreet, avoiding any appearance
of superiority, carefully guarding against personal allusions, even
to his most bitter enemies. He spoke ill of no individual, and checked
slander in others whenever he discovered it. His morals were of the
purest order, his philanthropy was of the loftiest kind. As a public
servant, a private citizen, a kind husband, a faithful father, a warm
friend, an honourable enemy and a noble patriot, the name of <span class="smcap">George
Clymer</span> stands pre-eminent.</p>

<p>He was of the middle size, well formed, fair complexion, with a
countenance attractive, intelligent, expressive of a strong mind, pleasing
and ingenuous. He closed his long and useful career on the 23d
of January, 1813, at the residence of his son at Morrisville, Berks
county, in his native state, most deeply mourned by those who knew
him best.</p>

<hr />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_33">CARTER BRAXTON.</h2>
</div>

<p>It often happens that those who forget right and abuse power undermine
the foundation of their own citadel, and prepare the way to
be shorn of their present enjoyments by an improper course to enhance
them. Thus it was with England. Previous to the causes
that produced the American revolution, the idea of a separation from
the mother country, and of forming an independent government, had
probably never entered the minds of but few of the patriots who were
engaged in its consummation. When the impolitic measures towards
the colonists were first commenced, relying upon their chartered
rights, based upon the British constitution as they were, they believed
their grievances would and must be redressed by the king, when
properly requested by petitions. These were repeatedly forwarded
to him, couched in the most respectful and eloquent language, to
which he turned a deaf ear. Parliament was appealed to in vain.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Remonstrances formed the next link in the chain. They also were
treated with contempt. A formal demand to desist from oppression
in bold, but still in respectful language, breathing allegiance to the
king in every word, was the next resort—but all to no purpose. The
ministerial cry, <em>give</em>—<em>give</em>—<em>give</em>—resounded from Albion’s shore,
and pierced afresh the sensibilities of the imploring suppliants. Resolutions
of non-importation followed; these produced menaces from
the British military, a preparation for resistance by the colonies succeeded;
American blood was spilt; the tocsin of war was sounded;
millions rushed to the conflict; the struggle was long, doubtful, and
bloody; the patriots triumphed; the power of Britain was dissolved;
Columbia was free and patriots rejoiced.</p>

<p>Among them stood <span class="smcap">Carter Braxton</span>, the son of George Braxton,
a wealthy planter, who resided on the north bank of Mattapony river,
where he owned a valuable plantation, situated in the county of King
and Queen, Virginia. At that beautiful place Carter was born, on
the 10th of September, 1736. His paternal and maternal connections
were highly respectable and wealthy, and several of them officers of
the crown at various periods. He was liberally educated at the college
of William and Mary, and reared amidst all the splendours of
opulence, without the tender care of a mother to correct his childish
foibles, or of a father to guard him against the errors of youth; the
former having died when he was but seven days old, and the latter
when he was quite young. When but nineteen years of age, he married
the beautiful and amiable Judith Robinson, who was very
wealthy, and entered into full possession of his large estate, which,
united with that of his wife, constituted a princely fortune. She survived
but a short time, leaving him two daughters, the youngest but
a few hours old.</p>

<p>To assuage his grief, he sailed for England, where he remained for
nearly three years, during which time he added greatly to the store
of knowledge he had previously acquired, and became familiar with
the feelings, views, and designs of that kingdom towards his native
country. His rank and fortune gave him access to the nobility, from
whom he obtained much valuable information relative to the ministerial
conclave then concocting plans to raise money in America to
support royalty in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Although his family connections were favourites of the king, and
every thing around him was calculated to foster aristocracy in his
bosom, Mr. Braxton became a warm friend of liberal principles and
equal rights. Soon after his return from Europe, in 1760, he was
elected a member of the house of burgesses, and, in 1765, was an
ardent supporter in that body of the bold resolutions offered by
Patrick Henry, relative to the stamp act. From that time forward
he was a zealous advocate in the cause of freedom. He was one
of the house in May, 1769, when the proceedings of the members
excited the ire of the royal governor Bottetourt to such a degree that
he dissolved them without ceremony. They immediately repaired to
a private room in Williamsburg, and entered into a solemn agreement
not to import any articles from the mother country until their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
chartered rights were restored. The same members were elected to
the next session, and, being aware of the kind of materials he had to
manage, the smooth and shrewd governor lulled them into a more
quiet mood by the syren song of promises, assuring them that at
the next session of parliament the offensive revenue taxes would
be removed. Still cherishing hopes that their rights would be recognised,
they waited in respectful but watchful silence. Mr. Braxton
was an active member of committees and an agreeable speaker.
In the house of burgesses there were six standing committees, one
on courts of justice, one on public claims, one on elections and
privileges, one on trade, one on grievances and propositions, and one
on religion. Of the three last, then by far the most important, Mr.
Braxton was uniformly a member. In 1771, governor Bottetourt
died, and was succeeded by Lord Dunmore, who, being fresh from the
fountain of high notions and ministerial corruption, dissolved the turbulent
assembly then in commission, and issued his proclamation for
a new election. Mr. Braxton was then sheriff of his county, and
could not serve in the house. The people continued to live on promises
and hang on hope until the 27th of May, 1774, when the house
of burgesses again took a bold stand against oppression, and was peremptorily
dissolved by Lord Dunmore. He then dissolved the gordian
knot virtually; the people became enraged; eighty-nine of the
members, immediately alter the dissolution, formed themselves, with
many other patriots, into an association of resistance, and the fire of
freedom began to rise in curling flames. In August, a convention of
the friends of liberty met in Williamsburg, of which Mr. Braxton was
an active member. They elected seven delegates to meet the Congress
at Philadelphia, and bound themselves to act in concert with
the people of Boston, in the common cause against the common
enemy. Governor Dunmore had a new house of burgesses elected;
not being pleased with their proceedings he prorogued it several times,
until he prorogued himself, on the night of the 7th of June, 1775, on
board the armed ship Fowey, never again to assume his power over
the turbulent rebels of America. The Virginia convention met
again in March, 1775, and took every precaution necessary to put
their state in a condition of defence. In April following, Lord Dunmore
had caused the powder to be removed from the magazine, under
pretence that it would probably be needed in another part of the
colony, to repel an expected insurrection of the blacks. This enraged
the people, who assembled in large numbers, but were persuaded to
return to their homes by Peyton Randolph. Not fully satisfied, a
Spartan band soon after collected, headed by Patrick Henry, and proceeded
towards Williamsburg, determined on having the powder or
its equivalent. An armed force was sent from the Fowey to sustain
the governor; this only enraged the patriots; the spilling of blood
seemed inevitable. At that juncture Mr. Braxton and others interceded;
the powder was paid for by the receiver-general; Mr. Henry
gave a receipt for the money, and his troops returned home.</p>

<p>The flight of the governor was the dissolution of British power in
Virginia. For a time the government was managed entirely by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
committee of safety, of which Mr. Braxton was a member. On the
15th of December, 1775, he was elected to the Continental Congress,
and entered upon the duties of his new station with great zeal and
vigour. He had already seen much public service, and was prepared
to act well his part. He advocated, voted for, and signed the declaration,
the instrument that formally dissolved the maternal ties that
bound the pilgrim fathers to chains and slavery. On the return of
Mr. Braxton from Congress the next autumn he took his seat in the
first Virginia legislature convened under their republican constitution,
having been elected the May previous. A formal vote of thanks
to him and Thomas Jefferson, for their faithful services in Congress,
is upon the records of that body, dated the 12th of October, 1776.
From that time to his death, he was often a member of the legislature
of his state, sometimes in one branch and sometimes in the other.
He was a member of council when he died, and was in his seat only
four days previous to his decease.</p>

<p>During the war, he had lost a large portion of his fortune by the
British, and after its close he was extremely unfortunate, and was
reduced to indigent and perplexing circumstances. For a time, he
led his friends into speculative projects in order to resuscitate his
adverse circumstances, all of which proved abortive, injuring them
without benefiting him, and he finally sunk under a load of affliction,
which produced an excitement that was followed by paralysis, a
second attack of which ended his useful and eventful career at Richmond,
Virginia, on the 10th of October, 1797. Under all these trying
circumstances, his reputation did not suffer, he lost none of his
well earned fame as an able and faithful public servant, and an honest
and worthy man. His private character was of the most amiable
kind; he was a perfect gentleman and fulfilled all the relations of life
with fidelity. His name is justly placed high upon the list of enduring
fame, as a man who was a faithful sentinel in the cause of equal
rights, who contributed largely in consummating that independence
we now enjoy, that freedom of which we boast, that liberty which we
are bound to cherish, protect, preserve, and perpetuate.</p>

<hr />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_34">JOHN MORTON.</h2>
</div>

<p>Courage and fortitude, unaided by wisdom, often lead men into
unforeseen and unexpected difficulties. Combined, they form a power
for action equal to the lever, the fulcrum and the screw. Some men
possess a brave and dauntless spirit that knows no fear, but not possessed
of the helm of wisdom to plan and discretion to act, can never
become successful leaders. Guided by a wise prudence, blended
with a talent to conceive and a boldness to execute, the weak become
strong and effect wonders, at which they themselves look with astonishment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
after the mighty work is completed. To the unparalleled
wisdom of the sages of the American revolution we owe the blessings
of the liberty we now enjoy, more than to the physical strength of our
country at that time. Compared with the fleets and armies of the
mother country at the eventful era of the birth of our nation, the
available force of the colonies dwindles into significance. The one a
Goliah clad in armour; the other, a boy with a puerile sling. The
one, a giant in the vigour of his glory; the other, an infant bursting
into life. To the wisdom of the revolutionary sages, then, under
God, we must ascribe the success of the noble work they conceived,
planned and executed.</p>

<p>As a cool, deliberate and prudent man, the name of John Morton
is memorable. He was born in Ridley, Delaware county, Pennsylvania,
about four miles from Chester, in the year 1724. His ancestors
immigrated from Sweden at an early period, and settled along
the Delaware not far from Philadelphia. The father of John Morton,
of the same christian name, married Mary Richards when he was very
young, and died before his son was born, and before he arrived at his
majority. The widow was subsequently married by John Sketchly, an
intelligent Englishman, who proved a good husband and a kind step-father.
Mr. Morton was principally indebted to him for his education,
having enjoyed the advantages of a school but three months.
Himself a skilful surveyor and well versed in mathematics, he made
his step-son master of that important science. No branch of education
is as well calculated to lead the mind into the path of precision
of thought and action as this. Based upon invariable truth and lucid
demonstration, never resting on false premises, always arriving at incontrovertible
conclusions, it gives a tone to the mental powers calculated
to produce the most beneficial results.</p>

<p>Young Morton continued with his parental guardian until manhood
dawned upon him, aiding in the management of the farm and in surveying,
constantly storing his mind with useful and substantial knowledge,
blending and testing theory with practice. In 1764, he was
commissioned a justice of the peace, and shortly after was elected to
the assembly of his native state. He soon became conspicuous, and
was subsequently speaker of the house during several sessions. He
took a deep interest in the welfare of his country, and was a member
of the Congress assembled at New York in 1765 to concert measures
for the repeal of the odious stamp act. He concurred in the strong
and bold measure of that body, which virtually kindled the fire of the
revolution, which, although smothered for a time, was never extinguished
until it consumed the last vestige of British power in America.
In 1767, he became the sheriff of his county, which station he
ably filled for three years. He was then appointed president judge
of his district, and rose rapidly in the estimation of his fellow citizens.
He also endeared himself to society by a matrimonial connection
with Miss Anne Justis of the state of Delaware, an amiable and
accomplished lady, who contributed largely to his happiness in life.
Soon after the clarion of war was sounded from the heights of Lexington,
the indignation of the people in his neighbourhood was so roused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
that they raised a battalion of volunteers and elected judge Morton
colonel. He was under the necessity of declining the proffered honour,
having recently been appointed a judge of the supreme court of Pennsylvania.
In July, 1774, he was appointed by the assembly of that
state a member of the Congress that convened in Philadelphia in September
following. The object of that Congress was to effect peace
and reconciliation between the two countries, and contract, instead
of enlarging, the breach of amity. Men of wisdom and deep thought,
fired by a holy patriotism, were selected for the all-important deliberations
on which depended the future destiny of themselves and unborn
millions. When they assembled, a deep and awful solemnity
pervaded every mind. The proceedings were opened by prayer, and
every soul seemed to commune with the spirits of another world, as by
vesper orisons. After the address to the throne of grace was closed, a
protracted silence ensued; nought but the flitting of the purple stream
and the throbbing of anxious hearts was heard. The trembling tears
and quivering lip told the emotions of many a bosom, too strong to be
endured, too full to be expressed, too deep to be fathomed. At length
the mighty spirit of Henry burst forth in the majesty of its native
glory, and broke the magic spell. In bold and glowing colours,
strongly shaded with dignified sincerity, and painted upon the canvass
of eternal justice and truth, he presented American rights and
British wrongs. When he closed, every patriot responded a hearty—Amen.
Their mouths were opened, their burdens lightened, and
they could breathe more freely.</p>

<p>In May of the next year, judge Morton again took his seat in Congress,
and in November following was re-elected, although then
speaker of the assembly of his state. In July, 1776, he attended that
august body for the last time, and placed an enduring seal upon the
bright escutcheon of his name, by signing the chart of liberty, the
manifesto of freemen against the usurpations of tyranny.</p>

<p>During the time he was in Congress, he rendered very efficient services,
and was highly esteemed as a cool, deliberate, discerning man;
purely patriotic, firm in his principles, and anxious to do all in his
power to promote the righteous cause of his bleeding country. With
all these feelings resting upon his mind, he was among those who
weighed deeply the consequences of severing the bonds that bound
the colonies to the mother country. Unsustained, the step was death
or a more cruel slavery. To all human appearance the patriots must
be crushed by the physical force of their enemies then pouring in upon
them. There were five delegates from his state, two of them had determined
on going against the measure, which left him to give the
casting vote. The responsibility he considered of the greatest magnitude.
On it depended the enhanced misery or the happy deliverance
of his country. The former he feared, the latter he hoped for.
When the time arrived for final action, his patriotism preponderated
over his doubts, and he cast his vote in favour of the important instrument
that was to prove either the warrant of death or the diploma of
freedom. Some of his old friends censured him strongly for the bold
act, and would not be reconciled to him, even when he lay upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
bed of death; so strong were the feelings of men during the revolution.
His dying message to them showed that his conscience approved
the work his hand had done. “Tell them that they will live
to see the hours when they shall acknowledge it to have been the
most glorious service that I have ever rendered to my country.” The
truth of his prophecy has been most happily verified.</p>

<p>When the articles of confederation were under discussion by Congress,
judge Morton was frequently chairman of the committee of the
whole, and performed the duty with great dignity and ability.</p>

<p>In April, 1777, he was attacked with a violent fever, highly inflammatory,
which terminated his life in a few days, in the midst of his
usefulness, with fresh honours awaiting him as time advanced. His
premature death was deeply mourned by his bereaved companion,
eight children, a large concourse of intimate friends, by the members
of the bar, by his associate judges, by the state legislature, by Congress,
and by every patriot of his country.</p>

<p>As a private citizen, he possessed an unusual share of esteem. He
was endowed with all the amiable qualities that enrich the domestic
and social circle, and, as a crowning glory to his fair fame, he professed
and adorned the Christian religion, and died triumphing in
faith. His dust reposes in the cemetery of St. James’ church, in
Chester; his name is recorded on the enduring tablet of fame. His
examples are worthy of imitation; his brief career admonishes us of
the uncertainty of life; his happy demise is an evidence of the truth
of real piety.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_35">RICHARD HENRY LEE.</h2>
</div>

<p>A strong propensity exists in every investigating, reflecting mind,
to explore the labyrinthian abysm of the past. The classic reader
dwells with rapture upon oriental time. Its remoteness sheds around
it a sacredness that increases veneration, and leaves the fancy to
wonder and admire. Human foibles descend with the body to the
tomb, and are covered by the mantle of oblivion. Human faults, not
enrolled on the black catalogue of crime, are often eclipsed by transcendant
virtues, find no place upon the historic page, and leave after
generations to gaze at a picture of native beauty, which, as time rolls
over it, assumes deeper and holier shades, until it commands the reverence
of all who behold it. The names of Demosthenes, Cicero,
Socrates, Solon, Cincinnatus, and many others, over whose dust centuries
have rolled, are referred to with as profound respect as if
angel purity had stamped their every action with the impress of divinity.
The same bright portrait awaits the name of every good and
great man. That of each of the signers of the declaration of independence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
has long attracted the earnest gaze of admiring millions,
and becomes more sacred as time advances.</p>

<p>Upon the tablet of enduring fame, stands the name of <span class="smcap">Richard
Henry Lee</span>, in bold relievo. He was the son of Thomas Lee, and
born in Westmoreland county, Virginia, on the 20th of January,
1732. His ancestors were among the early settlers of the Old Dominion,
and among those who guided the concerns and directed the
destinies of the colony. They were the friends of liberal principles,
and at all times resisted every encroachment upon their rights. The
arbitrary power exercised by Charles the first over his European
subjects, which hurled him from his throne, was successfully resisted
by the Lees of Virginia. When Cromwell assumed the crown, his
power was not recognised by this colony, and the mandate that first
proclaimed the second Charles king, originated with Lee and Berkley
of the Old Dominion.</p>

<p>The plan of ultimate independence seems to have been long cherished
and nursed by the elder Lees. Through the bright vista of
the future they contemplated the millennium of freedom in America.
So strongly impressed was the father of the present subject with this
idea, that he fixed in his mind the location of the seat of government,
and in view of this, purchased lands in the vicinity of Washington.
By some historians this is called a paradox which philosophy has been
perplexed to explain. To my mind the solution is involved in no
mysterious perplexity. A man of deep reflection does not draw his
conclusions from present appearances alone. He compares the past
with the present, from which he makes deductions for the future.
The historic map of the old world is covered with the rise, progress,
and downfall of kingdoms and nations. Judging from the causes that
produced them, and the results that followed, it was the natural conclusion
of a penetrating mind, that the expansive territory we now
possess, with all the bounties of nature lavished upon it, and with intelligent
and enterprising immigrants pouring in upon it, must eventually
be so densely populated that its physical force would become
too strong for any European power to maintain a dominion over it.
Its geographical centre, with reference to the settlements then in progress,
was equally plain. The “prophecy,” as it has been termed,
was the result of deep thought, arriving at conclusions drawn from
the laws of nature, and shows that Mr. Lee possessed an analyzing
mind that moved in a broad circumference.</p>

<p>Richard Henry Lee commenced his education at Wakefield, Yorkshire,
England, and remained in that kingdom until he completed it.
He returned a finished scholar and an accomplished gentleman, with
a reputation untarnished by folly or vice. From his youth his integrity
and morality were of the purest order; he delighted in reposing
under the ethic mantle. During his absence his innate republicanism
did not become tinctured with the farina of European courts, or the
etiquette of aristocracy. In classic history he found the true dignity
of man portrayed, and his inalienable rights delineated. In the philosophy
of Locke he saw the rays of light reflected upon human nature,
and the avenues of the immortal mind opened to his enraptured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
view. In the elements of Euclid the laws of demonstration were
exhibited to his understanding, and aided in maturing his logical
powers. He was prepared to enter upon the great theatre of public
action, and to adorn the circle of private life. Endowed with these
qualifications, his services were naturally required by his country.
His first public act was to raise a body of troops and tender his services
to General Braddock. That proud Briton considered the provincials
puerile, and declined the proffered aid. His fate is a matter
of history. In 1757, Mr. Lee was appointed a justice of the peace
and president of the court. Shortly after, he was elected to the house
of burgesses, where he made himself thoroughly acquainted with the
laws of legislation, the ramifications of the government, the various
interests and policy of the colony, and with the rules of parliamentary
proceedings.</p>

<p>Retarded by an almost unconquerable diffidence, he took very little
part in debate at first, and it was not until he became excited by a
subject in which he felt a deep interest, that his Ciceronean powers
became developed. A bill was before the house imposing a duty
upon the importation of slaves into Virginia, so heavy as to virtually
amount to a prohibition. It met with strong opposition, and then it
was that Richard Henry Lee became roused, and poured upon his
astonished audience a flood of eloquence against the importing traffic
of human beings, that raised him at once to the pinnacle of fame as
an eloquent orator. He was proclaimed the Cicero of America. He
painted, in vivid colours, the cruelties of Cortes in South America,
of the Saracens in Spain, and then pointed his colleagues to the darker
and more barbarous practices that marked and branded with lasting
infamy the unhallowed slave trade. He also pointed them to the
bloody scenes of other times, when the physical force of those held
in bondage had enabled them to rise in their might and crush their
masters at one bold effort. By stopping the traffic the evil already
entailed upon them might be provided for, and the certain and dreadful
consequences of a constant influx from Africa be warded off. His
eloquence was applauded, but his doctrines of philanthropy were
voted down. The trade was then sanctioned by the government of
Great Britain, now so loud in complaints against us, for not providing
for an evil entailed upon America by the mother country.</p>

<p>The exposure of base corruptions practised by Mr. Robinson, then
treasurer of the colony, was the next important service rendered by
Mr. Lee. As this was participated in by the aristocracy of the
house it required much boldness, energy, and persevering sagacity
to introduce the probe successfully. This he effected in a masterly
manner, and proved clearly that the treasurer had repeatedly re-issued
reclaimed treasury bills to his favourite friends to support them in
their extravagance, by which means the colony, in paying them a second
time, was robbed of the amount. This act placed Mr. Lee on
a high eminence in view of every honest man.</p>

<p>When Charles Townshend laid before the British parliament the
odious and more extensive plan of taxing the American colonies,
which was seized upon as a <em>philosopher’s stone</em> by Mr. Grenville,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Mr. Lee was among the first to sound the alarm to his countrymen.
Within one month after the passage of the preliminary act in parliament
followed by a revolting catalogue of unconstitutional and oppressive
laws, Mr. Lee furnished a list of arguments against it to his
London friends, that were sufficient to convince every man of the injustice
and ruinous policy of the measure proposed, who was not
blind to the dictates of reason and madly bent on enslaving his fellow
men. When Patrick Henry proposed his resolutions in 1765,
against the stamp act, which brought out the full force of his gigantic
mind for the first time, Mr. Lee gave them the powerful aid of his
eloquent and unanswerable logic.<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> Associations began now to be
organized to resist the oppressions of the crown of which he was a
prominent and efficient member. The collector of stamps was compelled
to relinquish his office and deliver up his commission and the
odious paper, and the people were advised not to use it on any occasion.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_C" href="#FNanchor_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> See them at large in the life of Henry.</p></div>

<p>The <em>pen</em> of Mr. Lee was also ably used and produced many keen,
withering, logical, patriotic and sarcastic essays, that contributed
largely in producing a proper tone of enthusiastic patriotism in the
public mind. He also corresponded with the patriots of New York
and New England, and was the first one according to the testimony
of Colonel Gadsden, of South Carolina, and the public documents of
that eventful era, who proposed the independence of the colonies,
which tends to strengthen the allusion to his ancestors, who had for
a century before predicted this event. The idea had probably been
handed down from sire to son. In a letter from Richard Henry
Lee to Mr. Dickinson, dated July 25th, 1768, connected with the
statement of Colonel Gadsden, he proposes upon all seasonable occasions
to impress upon the minds of the people the necessity of a
struggle with Great Britain “<em>for the ultimate establishment of independence</em>,”
and “that a private correspondence should be conducted
by the lovers of liberty in every province.” His early proposition in
Congress to sever the maternal ties, was considered by most of the
friends of liberty premature and rash; but he had long nursed this
favourite project in his own bosom and was anxious to transplant its
vigorous scions to the congenial hearts of his fellow patriots.</p>

<p>Soon after the house of burgesses convened in 1769, Mr. Lee, as
chairman of the judiciary committee, introduced resolutions so highly
charged with liberal principles, sapping the foundation of the Grenville
superstructure, that they caused a dissolution of the house, and
concentrated the wrath of the British ministry and its servile creatures
against him. The fruits of their persecution were the formation of
non-importation associations, committees of correspondence, committees
of safety, and the disaffection of the English merchants towards
the ministers, in consequence of their impolitic measures, which were
calculated to prostrate the exporting trade to America.</p>

<p>Lord North now assumed the management of the grand drama
of oppression, and laid more deeply the revenue plan. By causing a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
repeal of the most offensive acts, he hoped to lull the storm of opposition
that was gathering, disarm the colonists of the spirit of resistance,
and, in the meantime, prepare for more efficient action. Had
the Boston port bill been omitted, his dark designing treachery might
have had a more triumphant reign. This roused the indignation of
the people and fanned the burning flame of patriotic resentment to a
<em>white</em> heat.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia Congress of 1774 was now planned, in which Mr.
Lee took his seat. At that memorable meeting he acted a conspicuous
part. After Patrick Henry had broken the great seal that appeared
to rest on the lips of the members as they sat in deep and
solemn silence, he was followed by Richard Henry Lee in a strain
of belles lettres eloquence and persuasive reasoning that took the
minds of his audience captive, and restored to a calm the boiling agitation
that shook their manly frames as the mountain torrent of the
Demosthenean Henry rushed upon them.</p>

<p>He was a member of the committee appointed to prepare an address
to the king, the people of Great Britain, and to the colonies. That
document was written by him and adopted with a few amendments.
He was also upon the committee that prepared the address to the
people of Quebec, and upon the committee of rights and grievances,
and of non-intercourse with the mother country. In the warmth of
his ardour, he proposed several resolutions that were considered premature
at that time, and were rejected; not because his purity of
purpose was doubted, but because many of the members still hoped
that peace might be restored by a timely redress of the grievances
they had strongly and clearly set forth in their petition and address
to the king and his advisers, and were not willing then to take any
action to widen the breach between the two countries. The proceedings
of this Congress were highly applauded by Lord Chatham,
as being without a parallel for solidity of reasoning, force of sagacity
and wisdom of conclusion.</p>

<p>In 1775, Mr. Lee was unanimously elected to the Virginia legislature
and continued to act with undiminished zeal. He received a
vote of thanks from that body “for his cheerful undertaking and faithful
discharge of the trust reposed in him during the last Congress,”
and was immediately appointed a delegate to the next. A more congenial
field was now opened for the ardent spirit of this devoted
patriot. Temporizing was no longer the order of the day. Vigorous
action had become necessary, and the zeal and industry of Mr. Lee
had ample scope. With all his might he entered upon the good work.
Upon committees, in the house, every where, he was all activity. In
1776, he was again a member of the national legislature, and in
obedience to the instructions of the Virginia legislature and of his
own conscience, on the 7th of June of that year, he offered the resolution
for the adoption of a Declaration of Independence, and enforced
it by one of the most brilliant and powerful displays of refined and
forcible eloquence ever exhibited by man. On the 10th of the same
month he was called home by the illness of his family, which prevented
him from taking his place as chairman of the committee upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
his resolution agreeably to parliamentary rules. Mr. Jefferson was
selected in his stead. The wrath of British power was now roused
against him. During his short stay at home, an armed force broke
into his house in the night, and by threats and bribes endeavoured to
induce his servants to inform them where their master could be found.
They persisted in affirming that he had started for Philadelphia. He
was not in his house at the time, but a few miles from it with a friend.</p>

<p>In August he returned to Congress and most cheerfully affixed his
name to that instrument which his imagination had dwelt upon for
years. He served until June, 1777, when he returned to Virginia
in order to confute a base slander, charging him with unfaithfulness
to the American cause, in consequence of his having received rents
in kind instead of continental money. He was honourably acquitted
by the assembly and a vote of thanks for his valuable services was passed
by that body. During the two ensuing years his health did not permit
him to sit in Congress but a part of the time, but in all the vast
concerns that occupied the attention of that body he took a deep interest
and aided by his counsel.</p>

<p>The portals of military fame were now opened to Mr. Lee. The
enemy, defeated in the north, made a rush upon the southern states.
He was appointed to the command of the militia of his native county,
and proved as competent to wield the sword and lead his men to the
field of epic glory, as he was to command the admiration of his audience
by his eloquence. He annoyed the operations of the enemy
in his vicinity whenever they approached, and made admirable arrangements
for the defence of the country under his charge. In
1780–1–2, he served in the legislature of Virginia. The propositions
of making paper money a legal tender, of paying debts due to the
mother country, and of raising a tax to support the clergy, or a general
assessment to support the christian religion, were then before the
house and excited great interest. Mr. Lee advocated them, Mr.
Henry opposed them. Upon the sacredness of contracts he based his
arguments in support of the two first; from the principles of ethics he
drew conclusions in favour of the last. He considered good faith in
the former necessary to secure peace and respect, and an adherence
to the latter necessary to correct vice and purge the body politic from
moral corruptions, the bane of any government. He remarked, “Refiners
may weave reason into as fine a web as they please, but the experience
of all times shows religion to be the guardian of morals.”
He contended that the declaration of rights was aimed against restrictions
in the <em>form</em> and <em>mode</em> of worship, and not against the legal compulsory
support of it.</p>

<p>In 1784, Mr. Lee was again elected to Congress and chosen president
of that body. At the close of the session he received a vote of
thanks for the faithful and able performance of his duty, and retired
to the bosom of his family to rest from his long and arduous public
toils. Under the federal constitution he was elected to the first senate
of the United States, and fully sustained the high reputation he had
before acquired. Infirmity at length compelled him to bid a final
farewell to the public arena, and, with the honours of a most flattering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
resolution of thanks for his many valuable services, passed by the
Virginia legislature on the 22nd of October, 1792, he retired to the
peaceful shades of Chantilly, in his native county, covered with laurels
of lasting fame. There he lived esteemed, beloved, respected and
admired, until the 19th of June, 1794, when the angel of death liberated
his immortal spirit from its prison of clay, and seraphs from heaven
wafted his soul to realms of bliss beyond the skies, there to enjoy
the rich reward of a life well spent.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee was a rare model of human excellence and refinement.
He was a polished gentleman, an accomplished scholar, orator and
statesman. In exploring the vast fields of science he gathered from
them the choicest flowers and the most substantial fruits. The classics,
belles lettres, the elements of civil, municipal, national and common
law, and the principles of every kind of government, were all
familiar to his mind. He was ardently patriotic, pure and firm in his
purposes, honest and sincere in his motives, liberal and republican in
his general principles, frank and open in his designs, and highly honourable
in his course. As an orator the modulation of his voice,
manner of action, and mode of reasoning, were a fac simile of his great
prototype, Cicero, as described by Rollin.</p>

<p>His private character was above reproach. He possessed and exercised
all those amiable qualities calculated to impart substantial happiness
to those around him. To crown with enduring splendour all
his rich and varied talents, he was a christian and an honest man.
Whilst his dust reposes in peace let his examples deeply impress our
minds and excite us to imitation.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_36">STEPHEN HOPKINS.</h2>
</div>

<p>Party spirit when based on selfishness, unhallowed ambition and
venal corruption, is a gangrene in the body politic. Its history is red
with blood—blackened by the darkest crimes, its career has been
marked with all the terrific horrors that demons could plan and wicked
men execute. It rides upon the whirlwind of faction; it is wafted on
the tornado of fanaticism; it is fanned by fell revenge and delights in
human gore. It has been the mighty conqueror of nations; its burning
lava has consumed kingdoms and empires; the fairest portions of creation
have been blighted by its rankling poison; countless millions have
fallen by its murderous hand; and, fearful thought! its end has not
yet come.</p>

<p>A few rare instances are recorded where parties have arrayed themselves
against power, prompted alone by pure motives and elevated
patriotism, guided by reason and sound policy. To be successful and
not violate the laws of wisdom and justice, the leaders of a party must
be men who are influenced alone by a desire to promote the general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
good, aiming at holy ends to be accomplished by righteous means.
The brightest example of this kind spread upon the pages of history
was exhibited by the sages of the American revolution. No convention
of men ever assembled to consult upon a nation’s rights and a
nation’s wrongs, graced with as much splendour of talent, sterling
integrity, self-devotion and disinterested patriotism, as that of the
Continental Congress of America.</p>

<p>Among them, the patriarch, <span class="smcap">Stephen Hopkins</span>, took a conspicuous
place. He was a native of Scituate, Rhode Island, and born on the
7th of March, 1707. He was the son of William Hopkins, a respectable
farmer, whose father, Thomas Hopkins, was one of the earliest
settlers of that province. The juvenile education of the subject of
this biographette was limited to the elementary English branches,
then but superficially taught in the common schools. From that
embryo beginning, he reared, from the force of his own exertions, a
towering and beautiful superstructure. Remarkably attached to books,
he spent all his leisure hours in the acquisition of knowledge. A
farmer in easy circumstances, he devoted a portion of the day and his
quiet evenings to the improvement of his mind.</p>

<p>No profession not literary, affords so good a chance for mental exercise
and reflection as that of agriculture. It is their own fault if
the independent tillers of the soil are not enlightened and intelligent.
The time was when ignorance was winked at. That dark age has
passed away, and now common sense and reason command all to
drink at the scholastic fountain.</p>

<p>Blessed with strong intellectual powers, Mr. Hopkins acquired a
thorough knowledge of mathematics at an early period and became
an expert surveyor. At the age of nineteen he married Sarah Scott,
whose paternal great grandfather was the first Quaker who settled
in Providence. After becoming the mother of seven children she
died, and in 1755, Mr. Hopkins married the widow Anna Smith, a
pious member of the society of Friends.</p>

<p>In 1731, he was appointed town-clerk, soon after which he was appointed
clerk of the court and of the proprietors of the county. The
ensuing year he was elected to the general assembly, and was continued
for six successive years. In 1735, he was elected to the town
council, and for six years was president of that body. The next year
he was appointed a justice of the peace and a judge of the common
plea court, and in 1739 was elevated to the seat of chief justice of
that branch of the judiciary. During the intervals of these public
duties he spent much of his time at surveying. The streets of his
native town and of Providence were regulated by him, and a projected
map made of each. The next year he was appointed proprietary surveyor
for the county of Providence, and prepared a laborious index of
returns of all the lands west of the seven mile line, then laid out, which
still continues a document of useful reference. Beauty and precision
marked all his draughts and calculations. In 1741, he was again
elected to the assembly. The next year he removed to Providence,
and was elected, soon after his arrival, to the same public body, and
was chosen speaker of the house. In 1744, the same honour was conferred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
upon him, as also that of justice of the peace for Providence.
In 1751, he was appointed chief justice of the superior court, and
elected for the fourteenth time to the general assembly. In 1754, he
was a delegate to the colonial Congress held at Albany, for the purpose
of effecting a treaty with the five nations of Indians in order to
gain their aid, or at least their neutrality in the French war. A system
of union similar to the confederation subsequently entered into
by the Continental Congress, was recommended and submitted at
that time, but was vetoed by England and not adopted by the colonies.</p>

<p>In 1755, when the triumphant victories of the French and their
savage allies spread consternation over the frontier settlements, a requisition
for troops was made by the earl of Loudoun, then commander
of the king’s forces. The quota from Rhode Island was four hundred
and fifty, and no one was more active than Mr. Hopkins in raising
them. The next year he was elected chief magistrate of the colony.
In 1757, the fall of fort William Henry and the sad reverses of the
English army, made it necessary that the colonists should raise an
efficient force for self-protection. A company of volunteers, composed
of the most respectable gentlemen of Providence, was organized
and Mr. Hopkins appointed to command it. The timely arrival
of troops from the mother country dispensed with the necessity of their
services. The ensuing year, this useful man was again elected chief
magistrate, and served as such seven out of the eleven following
years.</p>

<p>In 1767, party spirit was rolling its mountain waves over Rhode
Island so fearfully, that it threatened the prostration of social order
and civil law. Anxious for the welfare of the colony, this patriotic
Roman put forth his noblest efforts to check its bold career. In his
message to the assembly he expressed his deep solicitude for the restoration
of harmony, and offered to retire at once from the public
arena, if, in the opinion of that body, it would contribute in the
slightest degree to heal the political breach. To show his sincerity
he soon after retired from the public service, contrary to the wishes
of his friends. His picture of that era so much resembles the political
drama of the present time, in some sections of our republic at
least, that I cannot forbear presenting it to the reader.</p>

<p>“When we draw aside the veil of words and professions, when we
attend to what is <em>done</em> and not to what is <em>said</em>, we shall find in the
present age of our country, that liberty is only a cant term of faction,
and freedom of speaking and acting, used only to serve the private
interests of a party. What else can be the cause of our unhappy disputes?
What other reason for the continual struggle for superiority
and office? What other motive for the flood of calumny and reproach
cast on each other? Behold the leading men meeting in cabals, and
from thence dispersing themselves to the several quarters, to delude
and deceive the people. The people are called together in tippling
houses, their business neglected, their morals corrupted, themselves
deluded; some promised offices for which they are unfit, and those
who have disputes with their neighbours are assured of their causes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
whether they be right or wrong. Those with whom these arts will
not prevail, are tempted with the wages of unrighteousness, and are
offered a bribe to falsify their oath and betray their country. By these
scandalous practices, elections are carried and officers appointed.
It makes little difference whether the officer, who in this manner obtains
his place, is otherwise a good man or not; for, put in by a <em>party</em>,
he must do what <em>they</em> order, without being permitted to examine the
rectitude even of his <em>own</em> actions. The unhappy malady runs through
the whole body politic; men in authority are not revered, and therefore
lose all power to do good; the courts of judicature catch the infection
and the sacred balance of justice does not hang even. All
complain of the present administration, all cry out the times are hard
and wish they might grow better. But complaints are weak, wishes
are idle, cries are vain, even <em>prayers</em> will be ineffectual, if we do not
universally amend. Will no friend, no patriot, step in and save the
commonwealth from ruin? Will no good Samaritan come by and
pour in the wine and oil into the bleeding wounds of his country?”
Again, from his essay on the duties of freemen: “Permit me, therefore,
to remind my countrymen of the blood, the sufferings, the hardships
and labour of their ancestors in purchasing the liberty and privileges
they might peaceably enjoy. How can they answer it to fame,
to honour, to honesty, to posterity, if <em>they</em> do not possess those inestimable
blessings with grateful hearts, with purity of morals, and transmit
them with safety to the next generation? Nothing is desired but
that every man in the community may act up to the dignity of his own
proper character. Let every freeman carefully consider the particular
duty allotted to him as such by the constitution; let him give his
suffrage with candour for the person he sincerely thinks <em>best</em> qualified;
let him shun the man who speaks to him to persuade him <em>how</em> to vote;
let him despise the man who offers him an office, and spurn the sordid
wretch that would give him a bribe; let him think it his duty to give
his vote according to his conscience, and not depend on others to do
his duty for him. Let him know that as duty is not local, so neither
is capacity or fitness for office confined to this or that town or place.
Officers and magistrates I would humbly entreat to consider, that
their turn has arrived to serve the <em>commonwealth</em> and not themselves;
that their own discreet and exemplary behaviour is their chiefest and
best authority to do good in their offices; that it is vain to command
others to practise what we ourselves omit, or to abstain from what
they see us do; that where moderation and example are insufficient
to suppress vice, power ought to be used, even to its utmost severity,
if necessary; and, above all, that justice should be, in all cases and
under all circumstances, equally, impartially and expeditiously administered.”</p>

<p>This plain but lucid exposition of the duties of freemen, merits the
highest consideration of the private citizen, the able statesman, and
the profound judge. It is the effusion of a clear head, a good heart,
and a noble mind. It exhibits briefly and fully, in language of unvarnished
but sublime simplicity, the only sure foundation of a republican
government. It strikes at the very root of alarming evils, that at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
this moment hang over our beloved country like an incubus. It is
naked truth plainly told, and by us should be strongly felt and implicitly
obeyed.</p>

<p>Owing to the great reputation of Mr. Hopkins as a mathematician,
he was called in June, 1769, to aid in taking observations upon the
transit of Venus over the disk of the sun. So highly prized were
his services on that occasion, that the pamphlet published upon the
subject was dedicated to him. This rare phenomenon occurred in
1739–61–69, and will occur again in 1874 and 1996, if the planetary
system is not before dissolved, or changed in its primitive revolving
course.</p>

<p>Governor Hopkins had incurred the displeasure of the British ministry
previous to the revolution, by licensing vessels from Rhode
Island to trade with the French and Spanish colonies. So long as it
did not violate any act of parliament he continued to exercise the
privilege, and disregarded the authority assumed but not delegated,
of directing the local concerns of the colony. He had long been convinced
that the mother country cared more for the fleece than the
flock she claimed in America, which had often been left to contend
alone against a merciless foe. With convictions like these upon his
mind, a republican to the core, and valuing liberty above life, he was
fully prepared to resist the first scintillations of the unconstitutional
claims made by corrupt and corrupting ministers. When the stamp
act was passed, his voice and his pen were arrayed against it. He
showed clearly, that this and other acts of parliament had no foundation
in justice, and were contrary to the spirit of the constitution of
Great Britain. In 1772, the mountain torrent of local party spirit
having subsided in the colony, and its effervescence submerged
in the more absorbing question of British oppression, Mr. Hopkins
again took his seat in the assembly and continued a member for the
three succeeding years. In 1774, this patriarch statesman was elected
to the national Congress, and entered with a calm but determined zeal
upon the responsible duties of that august convention. The same year
he proposed and obtained the passage of a bill by the assembly of
Rhode Island, entirely prohibiting the slave trade in that colony; and,
to show that he strongly felt what he earnestly advocated, he emancipated
all his negroes, some of the descendants of whom still reside in
Providence. He had incorporated their freedom in his will dated
some time previous.</p>

<p>In 1775, he was appointed chief justice of the colony, was a member
of the assembly and member of Congress; holding, simultaneously,
a trio of offices. The ensuing year he was one of the immortalized
fifty-six by whose exertions a nation was born in a day, and who
signed, scaled, and delivered the certificate of legitimacy to their
grateful country. The same year he was president of the board of
commissioners of the New England states that convened at Providence
to consult and devise plans for the promotion of the glorious
cause of freedom. The next year he presided over a similar board at
Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1778, he was a member of Congress
for the last time, and the next year closed his long, useful and arduous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
public career in the assembly of his native state, and retired covered
with the rich foliage of unfading honours, the growth of nearly half a
century. The proud escutcheon of his public fame and private worth
was without a spot to obscure its brilliant lustre. As a municipal
officer, as a judge on the bench, as a legislator in the assembly, as
the chief magistrate of the colony and as a member of the Continental
Congress, he discharged all his duties ably, honestly, faithfully and
with a single eye to the glory of his country.</p>

<p>As a public speaker he made no pretensions to elocution, but was
listened to with profound attention. His reasoning was strong, always
to the point in question, and his speeches short. His was a
vigorous, clear, inquiring, analyzing mind, that surmounted every
barrier with the same fortitude, energy and determined resolution
that carried Bonaparte over the Alps, Sherman to the pinnacle of
fame, and Franklin to the summit of science.</p>

<p>He was a laborious and extensive reader and a friend to education.
He was one of the principal founders of the Providence Library in
1750, and when it was destroyed by fire ten years after, he contributed
largely to a new supply of books. He also framed and obtained
the passage of an act to establish free schools, and did all in his
power to promote the cause of literature.</p>

<p>He was a friend to unshackled religion, breathing charity for all
whose deportment gave the impress of divine grace—the only genuine
touchstone of true piety. He admired most the creed of the society
of Friends, which frequently held meetings at his house. All gospel
ministers were made welcome to his hospitable mansion, which was
not unaptly called by some “the ministers’ tavern.” He was plain
in all things and opposed to pomp and show.</p>

<p>In addition to his multifarious public duties, he was extensively
engaged in commerce, manufactures and agriculture. He was a systematic,
thorough business man, scrupulously honest, honourable and
liberal. He never became wealthy, but enjoyed a competence through
life. He was often placed in the crucible of domestic affliction. Of the
seven children by his first wife, not one survived him. One son was
murdered by the Indians, another died in Spain, and the youngest,
who was the fourth sea captain of the family, was lost at sea as was
supposed, his vessel having never been heard from after leaving the
port of Providence.</p>

<p>In the relations of husband, father, kinsman, friend, gentleman,
benefactor, philanthropist, Christian, neighbour and citizen, this
public spirited man and pure patriot was a model of human excellence.</p>

<p>His eventful career was closed on the 13th of July, 1785, after enduring
the course of a slow and lingering fever with the same calm
fortitude that had marked his whole life. He had lived respected
and esteemed; he died peaceful and happy. To the last moments of
his earthly pilgrimage he retained full possession of his mental powers,
and approached the confines of eternity with a seraphic smile that
augured heaven. He had long laboured under physical infirmities
of a nervous nature; for many years it had been difficult for him to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
write his name. He was interred at Providence two days after his
decease.</p>

<p>His demise produced a mournful sensation throughout the country,
and many from an unusual distance joined the numerous procession
that followed his remains to the silent tomb. Let us all imitate his
bright examples, that we may be useful in life, triumphant in death,
and exalted beyond the grave.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_37">ROBERT TREAT PAINE.</h2>
</div>

<p>The love of liberty and the oppressions of those in power, first induced
the pilgrim fathers to plant their standard on the granite shores
of New England. They were not a band of visionary unprincipled
speculators, but a band of intelligent, virtuous, pious, patriotic and
enterprising citizens, who were, from the commencement, willing to
risk their lives and fortunes in the cause of human rights. The early
forms of government adopted by many of those infant settlements,
were remarkably similar to those now in operation. The principles
that actuated the patriots of the revolution were recognised and
taught by many of the earliest immigrants. Although, in consequence
of the charters emanating from the king, an allegiance was recognised,
yet the people never intended to have those chains riveted upon them
from which they had fled, nor surrender tamely the rights and privileges
given them by the God of nature, and rendered more dear by
years of toil and fountains of blood. To understand, appreciate, and
guard these blessings, they correctly deemed <em>intelligence</em> the first
grand requisite. Upon this principle they started, upon this principle
they lived, and their happy example soon spread its benign influence
far and wide. Hence, we find more intelligent, wise, reflecting,
consistent, cool and deliberate men embarked in the cause of the
American revolution than in any other recorded on the pages of history.</p>

<p>Holding a conspicuous place among them, was <span class="smcap">Robert Treat
Paine</span>, a native of Boston, born in 1731, of highly respectable and
religious parents. His father performed the duties of a clergyman
until his health became impaired, when he embarked in the mercantile
business. His mother was the daughter of an eminent divine,
the Rev. Mr. Treat, of Eastham. From these pious parents he received
those principles of virtue that enabled him to be useful
through future life. Were there no other blessings flowing from religion
than its salutary influence upon the order and harmony of
society, mankind would be richly paid for adhering to its principles.
This consideration alone should close the <em>mouth</em> of every infidel opposer,
whatever may be the conclusions of his <em>mind</em> with reference to
its origin and reality.</p>

<p>At an early age, Mr. Paine was placed under Mr. Lovell, a classical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
teacher in Boston, where his embryo talents rapidly expanded
into a rich and luxuriant growth. At fourteen he became a student
at Harvard College. After closing his studies at this ancient seat of
learning, his parents, not only unable to aid him in business, required
his assistance to render them comfortable. He, therefore, before
commencing the study of a profession, employed his time for some
months in teaching a public school, a business as honourable as it is
useful, and which in point of dignity and compensation is now far
inferior to the days of Greece and Rome. Isocrates, for a single
course of lectures on rhetoric, received from one hundred of the
Athenian scholars, fourteen thousand eight hundred dollars. No
wonder the ablest talents were employed in advancing literature in
classic Greece.</p>

<p>Mr. Paine continued this business at intervals, which enabled him
to contribute to the support of his worthy parents and a maiden sister,
whose healths were impaired, and also to pursue the studies of his
profession. He commenced the study of theology, but ultimately
read and entered upon the practice of law. He first appeared at the
Boston bar, and from there removed to Taunton, in the county of
Bristol. He there acquired a firm and substantial eminence as an
acute, sound and discreet lawyer and able advocate. He enjoyed
the confidence and esteem of his numerous acquaintances. He was
among the earliest patriots who opposed the innovations of the crown
and boldly advanced liberal principles. He was a member of the
conventions of 1768, called by the citizens of Boston, to take measures
for the preservation of their sacred rights, and which Governor
Bernard vainly attempted to disperse before they completed their
deliberations.</p>

<p>He was employed, at the instance of Samuel Adams, by the people
of Boston to conduct the prosecution against Captain Preston, for
ordering his men to fire upon the populace on the 5th of March, 1770,
which duty he discharged with great zeal and ability. During the
gathering storm of the revolution, Mr. Paine was uniformly upon the
important committees of the people, and many of the boldest resolutions
that were adopted at the meetings and conventions of that trying
period were from his pen. In 1773, he was chosen a representative
to the general assembly, and was one of the members who
conducted the impeachment of Peter Oliver, chief justice of the province,
who was accused of acting under the direct influence of the
crown instead of the assembly. In this trial, Mr. Paine manifested
strong talent, and showed himself master of his profession.</p>

<p>In 1774, he was again elected to the assembly, and boldly warned
the people against the dangers to be apprehended from the appointment
of Governor Gage to succeed Governor Hutchinson. It was
plainly seen that the designs of the British ministry were to be enforced
at the point of the bayonet. An awful, an alarming crisis was
approaching. A committee, larger than at any previous time, was
convened at Boston, which advised and proposed the plan of a
General Congress. Governor Gage sent a messenger with an order
for them to disperse, to whom they refused admittance until they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
finished their deliberations, which resulted in the appointment of five
delegates, one of which was Mr. Paine, to meet those from the other
colonies at Philadelphia. This measure originated in Massachusetts,
and had been proposed as early as 1765, and was strongly urged in
a circular three years after. The set time had now arrived—the
galling yoke had become painful—and the colonies generally acceded
to the proposal. The ostensible object in convening this Congress
was, not to effect a separation, but to obtain a relaxation of the severities
imposed by the crown. It is believed a large majority of the
members when they assembled had never contemplated a declaration
of independence; but among them were bold and ardent spirits, noble
and patriotic hearts. As one of those, Mr. Paine stood conspicuous.
Their language continued to be respectful to the crown, but their
chartered rights they were determined to defend and protect. They
did not attribute their sufferings to a bad heart in their king, but to
the ambitious avarice of a corrupt ministry. Their proceedings were
calm as a summer morning, but firm as the rock of ages. They appealed
to their sovereign, to the British nation, to the American people,
and to a gazing world for the justice of their claims and the
equity of their demands. But to Britain they appealed in vain. The
cords of coercion were drawn with a stronger hand—their remonstrances
and petitions were answered by legions of foreign soldiers
in all the panoply of war—and servile submission or open resistance
were the only alternatives left. Mr. Paine was also a member of the
Provincial Congress of Massachusetts, convened at Concord, in October,
1774, and was the principal in preparing a spirited address to
the people of England, which did much to open the eyes of many in
the mother country, and rouse the colonists to a just sense of the injuries
of the British parliament.</p>

<p>The following year he was again elected a member of the Continental
Congress, and was placed upon many important committees.
He was as indefatigable in his labours as he was zealous in the cause
of human rights. He was chairman of the committee for the encouragement
of the manufacture of arms and for furnishing the army.
He used to say, “I fear we shall become slaves, because we are not
industrious enough to be free.”</p>

<p>Mr. Paine was appointed on the committee to prepare a constitution
for Massachusetts, and has the credit of framing that instrument.
He was again elected to Congress, and in April, 1776, was appointed
on a committee with Messrs. Jefferson and Rutledge to report rules
to govern Congress in their deliberations, and upon the committee to
inquire into the causes of the disasters of the campaign in Canada.—When
the glorious 4th of July, 1776, dawned upon Columbia’s sons
like smiling heaven, and the eagle of <span class="smcap smaller">LIBERTY</span> soared in peerless
majesty over their blood-stained soil, Mr. Paine was at his post.
With a buoyant heart and a firm hand he affixed his name to that
matchless instrument which is a terror to tyrants and the pride of
freemen. He did much to rouse his friends to action by his letters,
which he poured upon them in the most happy style. In his native
state he stood on the pinnacle of fame—in the national legislature he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
was universally esteemed. He was still continued a member of Congress,
and, when he could be spared, took a part in the legislative
proceedings of Massachusetts. In 1777, he was speaker of the House
of Representatives, and the same year was appointed attorney-general,
by the unanimous vote of both branches of the legislature. He was
a prominent member of the committee who formed the “regulating
act” reducing the price of labour, goods, &amp;c. to a standard of
equality. In 1779, he was elected a member of the executive council,
which, in conjunction with his other appointments, imposed upon
him constant and arduous duties. At the adoption of the constitution,
he was re-appointed attorney-general of his native state, and continued
in that office until 1790, when he declined, in order to pursue
some more lucrative business that he might provide for the wants of
a large and destitute family. He had been a faithful public servant
and had expended all but a bare and scanty support in the cause of
his country.</p>

<p>He was then appointed a judge of the superior court, which situation
he held until 1804, when his health compelled him to resign.
He discharged the duties of this office with great justice and ability,
and did much to advance the interests of religion, social order and
a sound state of society. On his resignation, he was elected a counsellor
of the commonwealth, and continued to impart his salutary
advice and influence to his fellow-citizens until death closed his
career on the 11th of May, 1814, when, calm and resigned, he fell
asleep in the arms of his glorious Redeemer, reposing full confidence
in His merits, and possessing a full assurance of a welcome entrance
into realms of transcendent bliss beyond the skies, there to enjoy the
rich reward of a crown of unfading glory through the rolling ages of
eternity.</p>

<p>In the life of Judge Paine, we have a picture which the christian,
the patriot, the legislator, and the statesman, may contemplate with
pleasure and delight. From the stations he occupied as the prosecutor
for the commonwealth, and as the administrator of its laws, he
obtained the reputation amongst some of being harsh, but no one
dared to accuse him of injustice. His integrity was above the reach
of slander. From his solicitude to confine a wayward son in the
paths of rectitude, he was accused of being unkind to his family, an
accusation as false as the heart was base that originated it. To his
family he was all kindness and affection. No stronger proof need be
adduced than his extreme anxiety for their welfare and usefulness.
He was a friend to literature, and the founder of the American
Academy of Massachusetts in 1780. The degree of LL.D. was conferred
upon him by the Cambridge University. He was a striking
example of the happy results of perseverance and industry, having
acquired his fame without the aid of patronage in early life, rising by
his own exertions, unaided by any, and administering to the comfort
of his aged and destitute parents. His career in public and private
life was marked with the purest integrity, the strictest morality, the
utmost consistency and the noblest patriotism. His life was a continued
round of usefulness; his labours were a blessing to mankind;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
his death was surrounded by a sacred purity that reached from earth
to heaven—his examples will be held in veneration by the great and
good to the remotest period of truth-telling time.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_38">GEORGE TAYLOR.</h2>
</div>

<p>A purely confederate republican government to answer fully its
beautiful theory, must be healthful and sound in all its parts, and be
wielded by enlightened rulers whose hearts are free from all guile,
whose judgments are strong and matured, whose characters are in all
respects irreproachable, whose conduct is in all things consistent,
whose patriotism and virtue extinguishes self and soar above all
temptation to digress from the most exalted honesty and rigid moral
rectitude, whose minds are stored with useful knowledge and large
experience, and whose souls are imbued with wisdom from above.</p>

<p>In such a condition and in such hands this kind of government is
calculated to elevate the mental powers of man, to spread before the
mind correct and liberal principles, and to promote social order and
general happiness by extending its radiant light, its genial rays and
its benign influence to the remotest bounds of the inhabited globe. In
such a condition and in such hands it would become the solar fountain
of intellectual improvement, the polar star of expanding science,
and a shining light to the human family. Its refulgent beams would
enrapture the ignorant, the oppressed, and the forlorn—its harmonious
links would form a golden chain that would reach the confines of
earth. It would be a messenger of peace, pointing and inviting the
weary pilgrims of bondage in every clime to a reposing asylum of
peaceful and quiescent rest. This is the kind of government intended
by the sages of the American revolution—this is the kind of government
they desired to form and perpetuate.</p>

<p>Among those who laid the foundation and commenced the superstructure
of our admired and expanding republic was <span class="smcap">George Taylor</span>,
a native of Ireland, born in 1716. His father was a clergyman
and bestowed upon him a good education. He then placed him with
a physician, under whose direction he commenced the study of medicine.
Not fancying the idea of becoming a son of Æsculapius he flew
the course, and finding a vessel bound for Philadelphia and ready to
sail, without consulting his friends and without money, he entered on
board as a redemptioner. Soon after he arrived in this country his
passage was paid by Mr. Savage, of Durham, Bucks county, Pennsylvania,
a few miles below Easton, for which he bound himself as a
common labourer for a term of years. This gentleman was the owner
of iron works where he lived, and assigned to his new servant the
station of <em>filler</em>, his business being to throw coal into the furnace when
in blast. He soon found this work to differ widely from that of handling
books and the pen. His hands became cruelly blistered, but being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
resolute and ambitious to gain the approbation of all around him,
he persevered without a complaint. The workmen, observing his condition,
named the circumstance to Mr. Savage, whose humanity induced
him to provide some less laborious employment for the young
foreigner. On conversing with him he discovered his intelligence,
education and talents, and immediately promoted him to clerk in the
counting room of the establishment. He proved fully competent to
his new situation, and gained the friendship and esteem of all around
him. Nor did he neglect the improvement of his mind. He applied
to practical use the theories he had acquired at school. His reflecting
and reasoning powers became developed. He made himself familiar
with the formula of the business, the customs and the government of
his adopted country. He became esteemed for his correct deportment,
and admired for his clearness of perception and soundness of
judgment. To add to his importance in society, the wife of Mr. Savage
became a widow and was subsequently married by Mr. Taylor,
by which he became sole proprietor of a large property and the husband
of a worthy and influential woman. By persevering industry
and good management he continued to add to the estate constantly,
and in a few years purchased a tract of land on the bank of the Lehigh,
in Northampton county, upon which he built a splendid mansion
and iron works, and made it his place of residence. He was not prospered
in business at his new location, and at a subsequent period removed
back to Durham. During his residence in Northampton county
he became extensively and favourably known, and in 1764, was
elected to the provincial assembly at Philadelphia, and took a prominent
part in its deliberations.</p>

<p>He had not been an idle spectator or careless observer of passing
events or of subjects discussed. He had examined the principles upon
which various governments were predicated, and became enraptured
with the federal republican system. He had watched, with a freeman’s
eye, the increasing advances of British oppression. He was too patriotic
and too bold to tamely submit to the yoke of bondage. So well
was he then known as a discerning and discreet man, that he was
placed upon the important committee of grievances. He also took a
bold stand against the corruptions of the proprietary government, and
advocated strongly an alteration of the charter, so that peculation
should be diminished and abuses corrected.</p>

<p>The ensuing year he was again elected to the assembly, and was
one of the committee that prepared the instructions of the Pennsylvania
delegation to the Congress that convened in New York in 1765,
to adopt measures for the restoration and preservation of colonial
rights. This document combined caution and respect with firmness
of purpose and deliberation of action. It instructed the delegates to
move within the orbit of constitutional and chartered privileges, and
to respectfully but clearly admonish the king and his advisers not to
transcend the limits of the same circle.</p>

<p>The stamp act was repealed shortly after, and Mr. Taylor was one
of the committee that prepared a congratulatory address to the king
on the happy event. So ably did he discharge his public duties that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
his name was uniformly placed upon several of the standing committees
of the highest importance, assigning to him an onerous burden of
legislative service. Upon the committee of grievances, assessment of
taxes, the judiciary, loans on bills of credit, navigation, to choose a
printer of the public laws, and others of importance the name of
George Taylor was generally found and often the first. For six successive
years he was constantly a member of the assembly. In 1768,
he was upon a committee appointed by that body to prepare an address
to the governor censuring him for a remissness in duty, in not
having brought to condign punishment certain offenders who had openly
and barbarously murdered several Indians, thereby provoking retaliation.
It was respectful and manly, but keen and cutting as a damask
blade. It was a lucid exposition of political policy, sound law,
and public duty.</p>

<p>In October, 1775, Mr. Taylor was again returned to the assembly
and added fresh laurels to his legislative fame. In addition to others
he was placed upon the committee of safety, then virtually the organ
of government. An awful crisis had arrived, the dread clarion of war
had been sounded, American blood was crying for vengeance, the revolutionary
storm had commenced, and the mountain waves of British
wrath were rolling over the colonies. Firmness, sound discretion and
bold measures were required. Mr. Taylor possessed the former and
promoted the latter. He stood forth a faithful sentinel in the cause
of freedom, not a blazing luminary, but as solid as the granite rock.
He was in favour of prudence in all things, but was not affected by
the temporizing mania that at first paralyzed the action of many who
desired liberty but dreaded penalties. He continued to exercise a
powerful and salutary influence in the assembly of Pennsylvania until
the summer of 1776, when he became a member of the Continental
Congress, and sanctioned with his signature to the declaration of rights,
the principles of liberty he had boldly advocated. Although Mr. Taylor
did not tempt the giddy height of refined rhetoric, he knew where
and when to speak, what to say and how to vote—the highest qualifications
of a legislator.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1777, he retired from Congress and from public
life, covered with the honours of a devoted and ardent patriot, an industrious
and useful legislator, an enlightened and valuable citizen,
a worthy and honest man. On the 23d of February, 1781, he closed
his eyes upon terrestrial things, bid a final adieu to earth and its toys,
and bowed submissively to the king of terrors. He died at Easton,
to which place he had recently removed. From the character of Mr.
Taylor the reader may learn, that without the luminous talents of a
Jefferson, a Lee, or a Franklin, a man may be substantially useful
and render valuable and highly important services to his country and
to the world.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_39">FRANCIS LIGHTFOOT LEE.</h2>
</div>

<p>Virtue affords the only foundation for a peaceful and happy government.
When the wicked rule, the nation mourns. Not that rulers
must necessarily profess religion by being attached to some visible
church—but they must venerate it, and be men of the highest moral
and political honesty. Disease and corruption affect the body politic
and produce dissolution with the same certainty that they prostrate
the physical powers of man. If the head is disordered, the whole heart
is sick. If the political fountain becomes polluted, its dark and murky
waters will eventually impregnate every branch with their contagious
miasma. The history of the past proves the truth of these assertions;
the passing events of the present day afford too frequent demonstration
of the baneful effects of intrigue and peculation. Without virtue
our union will become a mere rope of sand, the victim of knaves
and the sport of kings. Self-government will become an enigma with
monarchs, rational liberty a paradox, and a republic, the scoff of
tyrants. Let every freeman look to this matter in time. Let him
look back to the sages who wisely conceived, nobly planned, and boldly
laid the foundations of the freedom we now enjoy, but which cannot,
will not be perpetuated unless we imitate their examples and obey
their precepts. They were virtuous, many of them devotedly pious,
and all of them politically honest.</p>

<p>Among their number the name and character of <span class="smcap">Francis Lightfoot
Lee</span> claims our present attention. He was the son of Thomas
Lee, and born in Westmoreland county, Virginia, on the 14th of October,
1734. He was the brother of Richard Henry Lee, whose eloquence
rose higher but whose reflections were no deeper than those
of Francis. In childhood he was admired for his docility and amiable
deportment, in youth he was the pride of every circle in which he
moved, and when manhood dawned upon him he exhibited a dignity
of mind and maturity of judgment that his fellow citizens highly appreciated
and delighted to honour.</p>

<p>He was educated by the Rev. Mr. Craig, a Scotch clergyman, of
high literary attainments and profound erudition. Under his tuition
the germs of knowledge took deep root in the prolific mental soil of
young Francis, and produced plants of a rapid and luxuriant growth.
The Scotch literati are remarkable for deep investigation, thorough
analyzation, and lucid demonstration. I have never met one who was
a pedant, a vain pretender, or a superficial scholar. Under such an
instructor the intellectual powers of Francis assumed a vigorous and
solid tone that placed him upon the substantial basis of useful knowledge
and enduring fame. He became delighted with the solid sciences,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
and spent less time in the bowers of belles lettres than his Ciceronean
brother. The history of classic Greece and republican Rome
enraptured his mind with the love of liberty and liberal principles.
He read closely, thought deeply, and investigated fully. He prosecuted
his studies with untiring industry and became an excellent
scholar, without the advantages of European seminaries, to which most
of the young sons of wealthy men were then sent to complete their
education. Imitating the examples of his elder brothers, whose manners
had received the highest polish of English gentilesse and French
etiquette he became an accomplished gentleman. Raised in the midst
of affluence, actuated by moral rectitude, free from a desire to participate
in the follies of the world, living in the enjoyment of the refined
pleasures that promote felicity without enervating the body or
vitiating the heart, and a favourite among all his numerous acquaintances,
his earthly happiness was of the purest kind. With a mind
richly stored with scientific theory, with ethics and correct religious
principles, he entered the school of experience and became emphatically
a practical man. Possessed of an ample fortune he could devote
his time to such objects as he deemed most useful. Having early
imbibed the love of rational liberty, and having fully canvassed the
conduct of the British ministry towards the American colonies, Mr.
Lee resolved to oppose the encroachments of the king upon rights
and privileges clearly guarantied by the constitution of the mother
country. He could not consent that the trappings of the crown, the
pomp of the court, the extravagance of the ministry, and the expenses
of the parliament of Great Britain should be borne by the yeomanry
of America, eloigned as they were from the protection and good feeling
of that power—deprived as they were from being properly represented
in legislation—subject as they were to the caprice of every new
cabinet created by the king—threatened as they were to be dragged
from their native soil to be tried by a foreign jury—oppressed as they
were by the insolence of hireling officers—and driven as they were
from under the mantle of constitutional rights.</p>

<p>In 1765, he was elected a member of the house of burgesses to represent
Loudoun county, where his estate was situated. He became
an important advocate of equal rights and took a bold stand in favour
of natural and chartered privileges. Blessed with a strong and investigating
mind, a deep and penetrating judgment, a clear and acute
perception, a pure and patriotic heart and a bold and fearless disposition,
he became one of the most efficient advisers in the house. He
continued to represent Loudoun until 1772, when he married the
highly accomplished and amiable Rebecca, daughter of Colonel Tayloe,
of the county of Richmond, where Mr. Lee then permanently
located. The same year he was elected to the house of burgesses
from his new district, and continued to render valuable services and
exercise a salutary influence in that body until he was appointed a delegate
to the Continental Congress. Amidst the gathering storm of
the revolution and the trying scenes that accumulated thick and fast
around him, he stood undaunted, unmoved, and undismayed. He advocated
every measure calculated to promote the independence of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
country, and was prolific in plans for the accomplishment of the desired
object. As a member of committees he had no superior. An
extensive reader, he had made himself acquainted with the principles
of every form of government, and understood well the minutiæ of
magna charta and the British constitution. He was prepared to act
advisedly and safely, and determined to resist, even unto blood, all
the illegal advances of a base, designing and avaricious ministry. He
made no pretensions to oratory, seldom spoke in public, but when so
highly excited as to rise, he poured upon his opponents a flood of keen
and withering logic that often made them quail beneath its force.</p>

<p>On the 15th of August, 1775, Mr. Lee was elected a member of
the Continental Congress. A more expansive field was then opened
before him. To do or die, to live in chains or peril every thing for
liberty had become the dilemma. Columbia’s soil had been stained
with the blood and serum of Americans, shed by the very men who
had been cherished by their bounty and fed by the labour of their
hands. The dim flickerings of the hope of redress and conciliation
were fast expiring in the socket of forbearance. The great seal of
the social compact had been broken by the British ministry, the last
petitions, remonstrances and addresses to the king were to be prepared,
and the final course to be pursued by the colonies, determined.
Inglorious peace or honourable war were the two propositions. In
favour of the last Mr. Lee put forth the strong energies of his mind.
Eternal separation from England and independence for America could
only satisfy and meet his views. Being appointed upon many important
committees, his exertions to obtain this desideratum were unremitting,
and his influence was strongly felt. So highly were his
talents appreciated that he was often chairman of the committee of
the whole. So convinced were his constituents of his ability to promote
the best interests of the glorious cause of freedom, that they continued
him in Congress until his retirement from the public arena in
1779 to scenes more congenial to <em>his</em> mind, but less beneficial to the
deliberations of the august body he had so much benefitted.</p>

<p>When the proposition of final separation was submitted to Congress
by his brother, his soul was animated to the zenith of patriotic
feeling, and when the declaration of rights was adopted, his mind was
in an ecstacy of delight. His influence, his vote and his signature,
told how strong and pure were his desires in its favour. On that sacred
instrument, the chart of freemen and an eye-sore to kings, the
name of Francis Lightfoot Lee stands recorded—a lasting monument
of his civic fame.</p>

<p>He rendered essential aid in framing the articles of confederation
that carried the colonies through the revolution. This was a work
of great labour, and underwent, besides the time bestowed upon it by
the committee, thirty-nine distinct discussions in the house. He contended
ardently that the rights of contiguous fisheries and the free
navigation of the Mississippi river should be incorporated in the
claims of the United States upon Great Britain in all propositions of
peace. The wisdom and sagacity of his position is now fully demonstrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
although it then met with opposition by some, and was considered
as a matter of secondary importance by others.</p>

<p>A late writer has charged the “Lees of Virginia” with hostility
towards Washington, which, unqualified as it stands, includes Francis
with the rest. This hostile feeling, he asserts, arose from the sentence
of the court martial in 1778, that suspended General Charles
Lee from holding any commission in the American army for one year.
Had the writer consulted the records of Congress he might have avoided
this error. Francis Lightfoot Lee was the only one of the name
in Congress at that time. The sentence was acted upon and sanction
by that body, and Mr. Lee voted in its favour. He was ever a
warm friend of the illustrious Washington, and I have yet to learn
that his brothers were not also. General Lee was a native of North
Wales, and, excepting a short time during his youth, was not in America
until 1773, and could not have had the same claims of friendship
upon the “Lees of Virginia” as the father of our country. He was
an accomplished and brave officer, having served in Portugal under
Burgoyne, and in the army of Poland, and other places, from the time
he was eleven years old until his unfortunate dereliction from orders
at the battle of Monmouth. He died in Philadelphia in 1782. Another
evidence that Mr. Lee held the hero of the revolution in veneration
is of a later date. After the adoption of the federal constitution
he was asked his opinion upon it. He answered, with an air of seriousness,
“I am old and do not pretend to judge these things now, but
one thing satisfies me it is all right—General Washington is in favour
of it and John Warden is opposed to it.” Mr. Warden was opposed
to American independence.</p>

<p>After he retired from Congress he enjoyed the domestic circle but
for a short season. He was elected to the legislature of his native
dominion contrary to his wishes, but promptly repaired to the post of
public duty. After aiding in the removal of the most perplexing difficulties
that embarrassed the government of the state, he again retired
to the peaceful shades of private life, where he remained until April,
1797, when, calm and resigned, he obeyed the summons of the messenger
of death, bid an affectionate farewell to his friends and the
world, and took his departure “to that country from whose bourne
no traveller returns,” triumphing in faith, rejoicing in death, with
the full assurance of a crown of glory in a brighter and better world.</p>

<p>In public life Mr. Lee was eminently useful; his private worth and
excellence shone with equal brilliancy. Always cheerful, amusing
and instructive, he was the delight of every circle in which he
moved. Wealthy, liberal and benevolent, he was the orphan’s father,
the widow’s solace and the poor man’s friend. Kind, affectionate and
intelligent, he was a good husband, a faithful companion, and a safe
counsellor. Polished, urbane and gentlemanly, his examples were
calculated to refine the manners of those around him. Moral, discreet
and pious, his precepts had a salutary influence upon the minds
of all who heard them and were not callous to good advice. He died
of pleurisy, resulting from a heavy cold, and, within a few days of each
other, himself and wife were both laid beneath the clods of the valley.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
They had no children to mourn their loss, but their graves were moistened
by the tears of numerous relatives and friends. Let the shining
examples of this good man be reflected forcibly upon our minds, that
our country may be benefitted by us in time, and that our final exit
from earth may be peaceful and happy.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_40">THOMAS STONE.</h2>
</div>

<p>A man who has a just sense of the responsibilities of a high public
office, will seldom seek one, unless impelled by impending dangers
that threaten to injure or destroy the best interests of his country.
The more clearly a modest unassuming man perceives the magnitude
of a public trust, the more he distrusts his own capacity to discharge
its duties, yet such a man is the very one to be safely trusted. It was
with great diffidence that Washington undertook the command of the
American armies, yet no one can be pointed out who possessed as
fully all the requisites to meet “the times that tried men’s souls.”
John Hancock quailed under his appointment as president of the Continental
Congress, yet no one could have manifested more firmness
in the cause of liberty, or have presided with more dignity.</p>

<p>It is only in times of danger that men of the <em>greatest</em> worth become
<em>most</em> conspicuous. They are then <em>sought</em> out by the virtuous part of
the community, and sometimes become prominent by throwing <em>themselves</em>
in the breach of danger. In times of peace and prosperity, the
same men may be called to the councils of a nation without exciting
astonishment or unusual applause, and the names of noisy political
partisans may become more extensively known and be wider spread
upon the wings of venal party newspapers than theirs. It is in such
times that men of the greatest merit shrink from the public gaze,
and it is in such times that the canker worm of political intrigue carries
on the work of destruction in the body politic. It is in times of
peril that men of deep thought, cool deliberation and sterling honesty,
become most prominent and receive the full reward of merit. This
fact was fully demonstrated during the American revolution. Many
were then called to deliberate in the solemn assemblies of that eventful
era who had not been previously known as public men, and who
retired as soon as the mighty work of independence was completed.
They were selected in consequence of their strict integrity and sound
discretion.</p>

<p>Of this class was <span class="smcap">Thomas Stone</span>, a descendant of William Stone,
who was governor of Maryland during the reign of Cromwell. He
was born at Pointon Manor, Charles county, Maryland, in 1743. He
was well educated under the liberal and classical instruction of a
Scotch clergyman, and studied the profession of law with Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Johnson of Annapolis. He commenced a successful practice at that
place, and was held in high estimation by the community in which he
lived. Modest, retiring and unassuming in his manners, an industrious
man of business, a close student, a safe and judicious counsellor,
he was beloved and admired for his substantial worth and
sterling merit. He possessed a clear head, a sound judgment, and a
good heart. His mind was vigorous, analyzing, investigating, and
patriotic. He was a friend to equal rights, and delighted in seeing
every person happy. He detested oppression in all its varied shades.
He was kind, noble and benevolent. With feelings like these he
was not a careless observer of the infringements of the Grenville
administration upon the constitutional and chartered rights of his fellow
citizens. When the stamp act was promulged, he was a youth
in politics, but the discussions upon its odiousness deeply interested
him. He was an attentive listener and a thorough investigator. His
opposition to it became firm; a holy indignation pervaded his bosom
and prepared him for future action. Still he avoided the public gaze.
With his friends in the private circle he conversed freely, lucidly
and understandingly upon the subject of American rights and British
wrongs, but could not be induced to mount the rostrum of the forum
and display his forensic powers until a short time before he was called
by his country to deliberate in her national council.</p>

<p>When the Boston port bill was proclaimed, Mr. Stone surmounted
the barriers of diffidence and rushed promptly to the rescue. His
example had a salutary influence upon those around him. All knew
that something must be radically wrong, that some portentous danger
hung over the colonies when Thomas Stone was roused to public
action. The influence of such men as him, in times of peril, is of the
highest value. The man who is always or often a declaimer in popular
meetings, must possess Demosthenean or Ciceronian powers to
command attention for a long time. The cool, the reflecting, the calculating,
the timid and the wavering, are operated upon as by magic,
where they see such a man as was Mr. Stone go boldly forward and
advocate, what to them seems a cause of doubtful expediency.</p>

<p>On the 8th of December, 1774, he was elected a member of the
Continental Congress, and took his seat in that body on the 15th of
the ensuing May. The meeting of that convention of sages had been
deeply solemn and imposing the preceding year, but at that time an
increased responsibility rested upon the members. The cry of blood
from the heights of Lexington was ringing in their ears; the fury of
the revolutionary storm was increasing; the clash of arms and mortal
combat had already commenced; the vials of British wrath were unsealed,
and the fabric of civil government was falling before a foreign
military force. To meet such a crisis, it required the wisdom of
Solomon, the patriotism of Cincinnatus, the acuteness of Locke, the
eloquence of Cicero, the caution of Tacitus, the learning of Atticus
and the energy of Virginius. All these qualities were combined in
the Continental Congress to a degree before unknown. Mr. Stone
commenced his duties with vigour and prosecuted them with zeal.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
He was at first trammelled by the instructions of the provincial assembly
of Maryland, that body being extremely anxious that peace should
be restored without recourse to arms. But the increasing oppressions
of the crown eventually removed this injunction and enabled him and
his colleagues to join cheerfully in all measures calculated to promote
the cause of independence. He was continued in Congress until 1777,
when he declined a re-election. He had been a faithful labourer in
the committee rooms, and an influential member in the house. He
had bestowed much thought and time upon the articles of confederation,
and felt bound to remain in the public service until they were
fully formed and adopted. That important work completed, he retired
from the halls of Congress, carrying with him the esteem and
respect of that body, the approbation of a good conscience, and the
unlimited gratitude of his constituents.</p>

<p>In 1778, he was elected a delegate of the Maryland legislature,
where he became an important and influential member. During that
session, the articles of confederation that he had aided in framing the
preceding term in Congress, were submitted for consideration. They
met with violent opposition at first, and were the subject of warm discussion.
Having been present at their formation, Mr. Stone was prepared
to answer the objections raised against them by lucid, clear,
logical and convincing arguments. He contributed largely in gaining
for them a majority of votes in the legislature of his state.</p>

<p>In 1783, he again took his seat in Congress and became a highly
esteemed member. Devoted to the best interests of his country, free
from political ambition, honest, frank, republican and sincere in his
principles, he was safely entrusted with the responsibilities of every
station he was called to fill. He was present when Washington resigned
his commission and retired from the field of civic glory to the
peaceful shades of Mount Vernon, amidst the loud plaudits of admiring
millions, and the mingled tears of joy and gratitude that stood,
like pearly dew drops, on the cheeks of his countrymen and compatriots
in arms.</p>

<p>The ensuing year closed the labours of Mr. Stone in Congress, and
completed his public career. During the last session in which he
served, he presided, previous to its close, as president <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro tempore</i>,
and, had he consented to a re-election, would, as a matter of course,
been chosen the next president of the national legislature. As a further
mark of public esteem, he was elected a delegate to the convention
of 1787 that framed the federal constitution, but having commenced
a lucrative practice of law at Port Tobacco he declined the
honour of serving. On the 5th of October of the same year, he was
prematurely and suddenly called to the bar of God to render an account
of his stewardship, and closed his eyes in death, deeply lamented
by numerous friends, a grateful country, and millions of freemen. He
was cut off in the prime of life, in the midst of usefulness, whilst the
prospects of future honours were opening brightly before him. But
he had already earned a rich and honourable fame, imperishable as the
pages of history, lasting as human intelligence. From the time he was
first known as a public man to the present, neither the tongue of slander<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
nor the breath of detraction have attempted to cast a stain upon
his reputation as a patriot, a statesman, a lawyer, or a private citizen.
He was a rare specimen of discretion, propriety and usefulness—a
true specimen of the very salt of the body politic, rendering efficient
services to his country without pomp or show, and without the towering
talents of a Cicero or a Demosthenes. Such men are always
valuable, and may be relied upon in the hour of danger as safe sentinels
to guard the best interests of our nation.</p>

<hr />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_41">LEWIS MORRIS.</h2>
</div>

<p>A military depotism is a national curse. Laws that require the
bayonet to enforce them upon a civilized and enlightened people, are
of doubtful efficacy. Moments of excitement may occur in the best
organized communities, arising from some sudden local impulse, that
require a show of military power and even its force; but when a
little time is afforded for reflection, reason resumes her sway, the
spirit of mobocracy subsides, the soldier again becomes the peaceful
citizen and rests for security upon the arm of civil power. Quartering
the military among the citizens of a community, is calculated to
produce numerous and serious evils. Let that military, after having
enjoyed the bounty and hospitality of the citizens, be directed to <em>force</em>
the execution of laws upon these citizens, oppressive in their nature
and ruinous in their effects, and an indignation is roused that is increased
tenfold from the circumstance of previous familiarity. Intimate
friends often become the most bitter enemies. Favours forgotten
and ingratitude displayed, add to the desperation of revenge.</p>

<p>Thus, previous to the American revolution, the military were often
quartered upon, or drew their support directly from the people. The
colonies had also contributed largely in money and blood to aid the
mother country in conquering her most inveterate foe in America—the
French in Canada. No return was asked but the enjoyment of
privileges granted and secured by the British constitution. This was
eventually denied. Petitions were treated with contumely—remonstrances
were laughed to scorn. Then it was that a band of sages
rose to vindicate the rights of their country, whose achievements have
no parallel in ancient or modern history.</p>

<p>Among the boldest of the bold was <span class="smcap">Lewis Morris</span>, who was born
at Morrisania, in the vicinity of the city of New York, in 1726. The
family documents of this Morris family trace their genealogy back
to Rhice Fitzgerald. Rhys or Rhice Fitzgerald was a Cambrian
chieftain, who carried his military operations and conquests into Ireland
during the reign of Henry the second. By his valour and success
he obtained the name Maur (great) Rhice, and the penultimate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Fitzgerald was dropped, and we now find the name as we have it
above. In tracing genealogy, we often find names as greatly changed
as this. From this original down to the present time, the various
branches of the family have been highly respectable, and have honourably
filled many important stations.</p>

<p>Lewis was the son of Judge Morris, of the same christian name,
who appears to have retained possession of the paternal estate formerly
purchased by his grandfather, Richard Morris, who was a
leader under Cromwell, and immigrated from Barbadoes about 1663,
and purchased a large tract of land near Haarlem, on York Island.
He died in 1773. He left an only son, Lewis, who was chief justice
of New York, and subsequently governor of New Jersey.</p>

<p>After passing through his preparatory studies, Lewis entered Yale
College at the age of sixteen. He became a good scholar and imbibed
from the president, Dr. Clap, a permanent relish for moral and
religious principles. In 1746, he took the degree of bachelor of arts,
returned to his estate and became extensively engaged in agriculture.
At that period the colonies were prosperous, free and happy. The
mother country had not yet contemplated the imposition of burdens
upon her distant children, and they were left to pursue their own
course without annoyance or molestation. Then they enjoyed the
fruits of their labours and reposed in peace.</p>

<p>In this happy retirement Mr. Morris continued to improve his
farm and his mind, and by his suavity and urbanity of manners, united
with moral rectitude and an honourable course, gained the confidence
and esteem of all who knew him. He became the nucleus of a circle
of friends of the highest attainments and respectability and was emphatically
the people’s favourite. His appearance was in every way
commanding. A noble and graceful figure, a fine and intelligent face,
an amiable and agreeable disposition, a warm and ardent temperament,
a benevolent and generous heart, an independent and patriotic
soul, crowned with virtue, intelligence and refinement, he was in all
respects to be admired and beloved.</p>

<p>The time approached rapidly when colonial repose was to be plucked
by the roots and wither beneath the scorching rays of British oppression.
The treasury of England had been drained by extravagance
and war, and her national debt had swollen to an enormous amount.
The story of prosperity and wealth in America was told to Mr. Grenville.
The plan of imperious taxation was devised. The stamp act
was passed. The sons of the pilgrim fathers were astonished and
amazed. They loved their king, but loved their country more. Legal
remedies were resorted to. A Congress was convened at New York.
Able addresses to the throne and the people of Great Britain followed,
breathing the purest allegiance conditioned on the restoration of
constitutional rights. The stamp act was repealed, but only to give
place to a more voracious and obnoxious family. In all these concerns
of his country, Mr. Morris took a deep interest, and from the
beginning, opposed even the approach of oppression, not at first as
a leader but as an adviser. Although Massachusetts took the lead
in opposition, New York made a strong show of resistance. In 1767,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
an act was passed by parliament compelling the people of that province
to furnish the British soldiers that were quartered among them
with provisions. By this order the burden fell upon certain portions
of the inhabitants exclusively and not pro rata upon the whole. It
was a direct invasion of personal rights and was most severely felt by
the citizens of the city of New York and its vicinity. This measure
brought Mr. Morris out. He publicly proclaimed it unconstitutional
and tyrannical, and contributed largely towards influencing the legislature
to place a veto upon it. Superior might eventually overpowered
this opposition and enforced the contribution from the citizens.
But spirits like that of Lewis Morris were not to be subdued. An
unquenchable fire was only smothered to gather strength beneath the
volcanic surface that then covered it. It was kept alive by fresh fuel
added by Mr. Grenville and his more subtle successor Mr. North.
The statute of Henry the eighth was revived, which doomed malecontents
to be sent to England for trial; the Boston port bill, its
handmaid, was passed and the cords of slavery were drawn more
tightly. The last petitions and remonstrances in the magazine of
patience were finally exhausted, and then it was that it was replenished
with more potent materials. Mr. Morris had now become a
prominent man, a bold and substantial whig, rather too ardent to send
to the conciliatory Congress of 1774. But the time soon arrived
when the people required just such a man, and in April, 1775,
he was elected to the Continental Congress. Even then the majority
attributed their sufferings to the ministers and not to the king, and
still hoped he would cease to be an automaton and prove himself a
man worthy of the high station he occupied. But hopes were vain,
the juices of the olive branch became absorbed by the sponge of venal
power, and the virtues of the sword were next to be tried. Already
had the purple current stained the streets of Boston and the heights
of Lexington—already had the groans of dying Americans, slain by the
hands of those whom they had fed, pierced the ears of thousands—already
were widows and orphans weeping for husbands weltering in
blood and fathers covered with gore. Vigorous measures of defence followed—legions
of foreign troops flooded the land—a dark and gloomy hour
had arrived. Soon after his appearance in Congress, Mr. Morris
was placed upon a committee of which the illustrious Washington was
chairman, appointed to devise measures to obtain a supply of the munitions
of war. This was a desideratum not readily acquired. Comparatively
a sling and a few smooth stones were all the patriots had
with which to commence the combat with the British Goliah. But
with all these disadvantages, the battle of Bunker Hill convinced
the veterans of Europe that men determined on liberty or death
were not to be tamely subdued.</p>

<p>Mr. Morris became an active and efficient member of the national
legislature, and advocated strong measures. Although his enthusiastic
patriotism bordered on what was then considered rashness, in some
instances, the very path marked out by him in 1775 was the one eventually
followed. He became early convinced that an honourable peace
could not be obtained <em>under</em> Great Britain, and was satisfied that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
nothing but a triumph <em>over</em> her would restore the equilibrium of justice
and chartered rights. During the interim between that and the ensuing
session, Mr. Morris was one of a committee appointed to visit the frontier
Indian tribes, to deter them, if possible, from enlisting under the
blood-stained banner of the mother country. He also visited the
assemblies of the New England states, in order to perfect plans to
raise supplies and prepare for a vigorous defence. In 1776 he again
took his seat in Congress, and was animated to find a spirit more
congenial with his views—a determination to sever the gordian knot
and proclaim an eternal separation from a nation that had held power
only to abuse it. He was placed on many and important committees,
and was active in and out of the house. In his native neighbourhood
Mr. Morris had no easy task to perform in rousing the people to an
efficient opposition. Governor Tryon, who was as wise and poisonous
too as a serpent, affected to be as harmless as a dove, and exerted
a powerful influence over the people of the city of New York in favour
of the crown. The commercial interests would be prostrated by a
war, the inequality of the two powers rendered the success of the
whigs problematical, and self interest, which was construed into self
preservation, operated for a long time against the cause of liberty in
that section. It required great exertions to surmount these obstacles.
Mr. Morris and his friends put forth their noblest energies in the
mighty work, and what <em>they</em> could not effect, British oppression and
the powder and ball of General Howe soon accomplished. The able
addresses that he aided in preparing and circulating among the people
do great credit to his head and heart as a patriot, a statesman and a
scholar. They are chaste, forcible and luminous. When the declaration
of independence was proposed Mr. Morris became one of its
ardent supporters. At that very time his vast estate was within the
power of the enemy, and he well knew that if he signed the instrument
proposed, should it be adopted, it was giving to them a deed of
sale, <em>alias</em> of destruction, of all his property that was to them tangible.
Most rigidly did they use the delegated authority. Even his
extensive woodlands, of a thousand acres, were subjected to axe and
fire, his family driven from their home, and every species of destruction
resorted to that malice could invent, ingenuity design and revenge
execute. But liberty was dearer to this determined patriot
than earth and all its riches. He boldly sanctioned and fearlessly
affixed his name to the great certificate of our national birth, and rejoiced
in freedom illumined by the conflagration of Morrisania. His
family and himself suffered many privations during the remainder of
the war, but suffered patiently, without regret for the past and with
brighter hopes for the future.</p>

<p>In 1777 he resigned his seat in Congress and repaired to his native
state, in the legislature of which he rendered important services. He
also served in the tented field and rose to the rank of major-general
of militia. He was an excellent disciplinarian and contributed essentially
in the organization of the state troops. In every situation he
ably and zealously discharged all his duties, and never left the post of
service until the American arms triumphed in victory, and the independence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
of his country was firmly established and acknowledged by
the mother country. Then he retired to his desolated plantation, converted
his sword into a pruning hook, his musket into a ploughshare,
and his farm into a delightful retreat, where his friends from the city
often visited him to enjoy his agreeable society, talk of times gone by,
and rejoice in the consolations of blood-bought liberty. Peacefully
and calmly he glided down the stream of time until January 1798,
when his immortal spirit left its frail bark of clay and launched upon
the ocean of eternity in a brighter and more substantial vessel. He
died serene and happy, surrounded by an affectionate family and kind
friends. His remains were deposited in the family vault upon his
farm, under the honours of epic fame and civic glory.</p>

<p>The examples of Mr. Morris illustrate the patriotism that impelled
to action during the revolution in a more than ordinary degree. He
had every thing that could be destroyed to lose, if the colonies <em>succeeded</em>
in the doubtful struggle; and if they did not, the scaffold, or
death in some shape, was his certain doom. He was, previous to the
revolution, a favourite with the English; and, what was more, his brother
Staats was a member of the British parliament and a general
officer under the crown. But few made so great a personal sacrifice,
and no one made it more cheerfully. Like Marion, he preferred a
morsel of bread, or even a meal of roasted potatoes, with liberty and
freedom, to all the trappings and luxuries of a king without them. So
long as this kind of disinterested patriotism finds a resting place in
the bosoms of Columbia’s sons, our union is safe—let this be banished
and the fair temple of our liberty will perish in flames kindled by its
professed guardians and sentinels.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_42">JOHN HART.</h2>
</div>

<p>Agriculture, of all occupations, is the one best calculated to rivet
upon the heart a love of country. No profession is more honourable,
but few are as conducive to health, and, above all others, it insures
peace, tranquillity and happiness. A calling more independent in
its nature, it is calculated to produce an innate love of liberty. The
farmer stands upon a lofty eminence and looks upon the bustle of
mechanism, the din of commerce, and the multiform perplexities of
the literati, with feelings of personal freedom unknown to them. He
acknowledges the skill and indispensable necessity of the first, the
enterprise and usefulness of the second, and the unbounded benefits
flowing from the last; then turns his thoughts to the pristine quiet of
his agrarian domain and covets not the fame that accumulates around
the other professions. His opportunities for intellectual improvement
are superior to the two former, and, in many respects, not inferior to
the latter. Constantly surrounded by the varied beauties of nature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
and the never-ceasing and harmonious operations of her laws, his mind
is led to contemplate the wisdom of the Great Architect of worlds and
the natural philosophy of the universe. Aloof from the commoving
arena of public life, and yet, through the medium of that magic engine,
the <span class="smcap smaller">PRESS</span>, made acquainted with the scenes that are passing
there, he is able to form cool and deliberate conclusions upon the
various topics that concern his country’s good and his country’s glory.
In his retired domicile he is less exposed to the baneful influence of
that corrupt and corrupting party spirit which is raised by the whirlwind
of selfish ambition and wafted on the tornado of faction. Before
he is roused to a participation in violent public action, he bears
much, reflects deeply and resolves nobly. But when the oppressions
of rulers become so intolerable as to induce the yeomanry of a country
to leave their ploughs and peaceful firesides, and draw the avenging
sword, let them beware—the day of retribution is at hand. Thus
it was at the commencement of the American revolution—when the
implements of husbandry were exchanged for those of war and the
farmers joined in the glorious cause of liberty—the fate of England’s
power over the colonies was sealed for ever. The commingling phalanx
of all professions was irresistible as an avalanche in the full
plenipotence of force.</p>

<p>Among the patriots of that eventful era who left their ploughs in
the furrow and rushed to the rescue, was <span class="smcap">John Hart</span>, a native of
Hopewell, Hunterdon county, New Jersey, born about the year 1715.
The precise time of his birth is not a matter of record, but his acts in
the Continental Congress are. He was the son of Edward Hart, a
brave and efficient officer, who aided the mother country in the conquest
of Canada, and participated in the epic laurels that were gained
by Wolfe on the heights of Abraham. He raised a volunteer corps,
named it the “Jersey Blues,” an appellation still the pride of Jerseymen.
He fought valiantly, and was recompensed by the <em>praise</em>, but
not the <em>gold</em> of the mother country. John Hart was an extensive
farmer, a man of a strong mind, improved by reading and reflection,
and ambitious only to excel in his profession. In Deborah Scudder
he found an amiable and faithful wife, and in the affections and good
conduct of a liberal number of sons and daughters he found an enjoyment
which some bachelors may affect to despise, but for which they
often sigh in vain. Eden’s fair bowers were pleasureless until Heaven’s
first best gift to man was there.</p>

<p>Known as a man of sound judgment, clear perception, liberal views
and pure motives, Mr. Hart was called to aid in public affairs long before
the revolution. For twenty years he had served in various stations,
and was often a member of the legislature of his native colony. He
took a deep interest in the local improvements, always necessary in a
new country, and also in the legislative enactments of that period.
He was a warm supporter of education and aided in the establishment
of seminaries of learning. He was a friend to social order and
law, and contributed largely in producing an equilibrium of the scales
of justice. In organizing the municipal government of his own county
he rendered essential service. Still his family and his farm were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
his chief delight—save his orisons to Heaven. He viewed all public
business as a duty to be performed when required, not as a political
hobby-horse to ride upon. The public men of that day spoke but little,
and then to the point, and despatched their business promptly.
Sinecures were scarce, and office hunters few and far between. Industry,
frugality and economy, in public and private matters, were
the marked characteristics of the pilgrim fathers. Golden days! when
will ye return in the majesty of your simplicity, and banish from our
land the enervating follies, the poisonous weeds and the impugning
evils that augur its destruction.</p>

<p>Observing and discerning, Mr. Hart was quick to discover the encroachments
of the British ministry upon the constitutional rights and
chartered privileges of the colonies, and was prompt in resisting them.
The stamp act, passed on the 22nd of March, 1765, was followed by a
commotion that showed by what a precarious tenure the king held his
power in America. When the Congress convened at New York, on
the first of October following, represented by nine of the colonies, Mr.
Hart was a member of the convention that made the selection of delegates
from New Jersey. The firm and discreet proceedings of that
body produced a repeal of the act complained of on the 18th of the
following March. Still the political alchymist, Mr. Grenville, was
madly bent on trying fresh experiments. The colonists had borne
the yoke of restrictions upon their trade and industry, which had been
artfully and gradually increasing for more than fifty years, to the advantage
of the mother country, and he concluded their necks had become
sufficiently hardened by long use to bear a more ponderous burden.
Poor fellow! he was as much mistaken in the metal he placed
in his crucible as the colonists were amazed and indignant at his
unwarranted pretensions. Direct taxation, without representation,
was taking an issue not warranted by the præcipe or narr, and
a general demurrer was promptly entered. An emparlance ensued,
replications and rejoinders followed, and the suit was finally
decided by wager of battle. Long and doubtful was the struggle—obstinate
and bloody was the conflict. The second edition of the revenue
plan, revised and stereotyped in 1767 by Charles Townshend,
chancellor of the exchequer, imposing duties on glass, paper, paste-board,
tea and painters’ colours, kindled a flame of indignation in the
colonies that no power could quench. Public meetings against the
measure, resolutions of the deepest censure, remonstrances of the
strongest character, and arguments of the most conclusive logic, were
hurled in its face; and to carry conviction to the minds of the ministry
that the people were in earnest, Boston harbour was converted into
a tea-pot and all the tea used at one drawing. Non-importation agreements,
committees of safety, preparations of defence, non-intercourse,
bloodshed, war and independence followed. In all these movements
Mr. Hart concurred, and deliberately, but firmly, opposed the encroachments
of the crown.</p>

<p>In 1774 he was elected to the Congress at Philadelphia, and, with
the frost of sixty winters upon his head, entered upon duties of higher
importance than had before devolved upon him. Mild, deliberate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
cautious, discreet, but firm in his purposes, he became an important
member to aid in carrying out the measures then contemplated—those
of reconciliation and a restoration of amity. He was highly esteemed
as a patriarch sage in the cause. The ensuing year he was again elected,
and repaired to the post of duty, of honour and of fame, on the 10th
of May. The cry of blood, shed on the 19th of the preceding April,
had infused a spirit in Congress widely different from that which pervaded
it a few months before. It was then that the Roman virtues
of such men as Mr. Hart shone with peculiar splendour. The impetuosity
of youth had passed away, their minds traced the deepest,
darkest avenues of every proposition, arguments were weighed in the
balance of reason, the causes, the effects, the objects, the ends, the
plans, the means, were all placed in the scale of justice and exhibited
to the inspection of those whose disposition led them to an examination.
In this manner every act was performed with clean hands, the
cause of liberty honoured, prospered and crowned with triumphant
success. At this time Mr. Hart was also a member and vice-president
of the assembly of his native colony, and shortly after, had the
proud satisfaction of aiding in its funeral obsequies and in establishing
a republican form of government. On the 14th of February, 1776, he
was again elected to the Continental Congress, and when the chart of
liberty was presented to his view, after carefully examining its bold
physiognomy, he pronounced its points, its features, its landmarks,
its delineations and its entire combination, worthy of freemen—gave
it his vote, his signature and his benediction, and soon after retired
from the public gaze and declined a re-election. As he anticipated,
the British soldiers devastated his farm, drove away his family, destroyed
his property, and compelled him, several times, to fly precipitately
to save his neck from the halter. Under circumstances like
these, no one will doubt the disinterested patriotism of the quiet
farmer, <span class="smcap">John Hart</span>. Not a stain rests upon his public or private character.
In all the relations of life he performed his duty nobly. He
was an honest man and devoted christian, a member of the baptist denomination,
and died in 1780, from an illness brought on by exposure
in flying from place to place to elude the pursuit of the British.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_43">BUTTON GWINNETT.</h2>
</div>

<p>Inconsistency is an incubus that assumes a thousand varied forms,
and in some shape hangs over every nation and most individuals. It
is human nature to err, but some errors there are, that, in the view of
reason and common sense, are so legibly stamped with inconsistency
as to enable every man of a sane mind to avoid them. Yet we often
see men of high attainments rush into the whirlpool of inconsistency
with a blind infatuation that seeks in vain for a justification, even by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
the rules of the most acute sophistry. Among the most fallacious and
opprobrious inconsistencies that now hang over our nation is that of
duelling. We boast of our intellectual light and intelligence, and
mourn over the ignorance of the poor untutored Indian. In his turn
he may point us to a dark spot upon our national character that never
tarnished the name of an eastern or a western savage. This Bohon
Upas of inconsistency thrives only in society that claims to be civilized.
In no country has it been as much and as long tolerated without
condign punishment as in our own. It is murder of the most deliberate
kind, and a violation of the laws of God and man. Has any
one of these numerous and blood-thirsty murderers, who walk boldly
among us, ever been punished to the extent of the offended laws of
our country? Not one. Widows may mourn, orphans languish, hearts
bleed, and our statesmen perish, and the aggressor may still run at
large, treated by some with more deference than if the escutcheon of
his name was not stained with blood. This foul stigma upon the
American name should be washed out speedily and effectually. The
combined powers of public opinion, legislative, judicial and executive
authority, should be brought to bear upon it with the force of an avalanche.
Flagrant crimes are suppressed only by strong measures.
This is the acknowledged policy of the penal code of every nation
where laws are known and respected.</p>

<p>Among the victims of this cruel practice, was Button Gwinnett, a
man of splendid talents and a pure patriot of the revolution, whose
private character was without a stain, and his public career as brilliant
as it was transient. He was born in England in 1732. His
parents were respectable, but not wealthy. Being a boy of promise,
they bestowed upon him an accomplished education, and at his majority
he commenced a successful career in the mercantile business at
Bristol, in his native country. He was commanding in appearance,
six feet in height, open countenance, graceful manners, and possessed
of fine feeling. Surrounded by an increasing family, he resolved on
seeking another and a broader country, and in 1770 embarked for
America. He landed at Charleston, S.&nbsp;C., where he commenced
commercial business and remained two years. He then disposed of
his merchandise and purchased a plantation upon St. Catharine’s
Island, in Georgia, to which he removed and became an enterprising
agriculturalist. He was a man of an active and penetrating mind, and
a close observer of passing events. Having been in England during
the formation of the visionary and impolitic plan of taxing the colonies,
he understood well the frame work of the British cabinet, and
from his course in the struggle that ensued, it is reasonable to infer
that he had imbibed strong whig principles before his removal to this
country. The subject of raising a revenue from the pioneers of the
new world had been long and ably discussed in England. Many of
her profoundest statesmen, and the most sagacious one that ever
graced her parliament, lord Chatham, portrayed with all the truth of
prophecy, the result of the unjust, the blind course of ministers towards
the Americans. Connected with commerce and intelligent men
as he was at Bristol, Mr. Gwinnett had become well informed upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
the litigated points in controversy, and was well acquainted with the
relative feelings and situation of the two countries. When the question
of liberty or slavery was fairly placed before the people of his
adopted land, he declared himself in favour of the latter. Knowing
as he did the superior physical force of Great Britain and the comparative
weakness of the colonies, their freedom, at first, seemed to
him a paradox. His doubts upon the subject were removed in 1775,
by the enthusiasm exhibited by the patriots, and by the lucid demonstrations
of Lyman Hall, a bold and fearless advocate of equal rights,
with whom he became intimate. Convinced from the beginning of
the justice of the cause, and now convinced of its feasibility, he soon
became a public champion in its favour. He had counted the cost,
he had revolved in his mind the dangers that would accumulate
around his family, himself and his property, which he truly predicted
would be destroyed by his enemies, and had deliberately and nobly
resolved to risk his life, his fortune and his sacred honour, in defence
of chartered rights and constitutional franchises.</p>

<p>He enrolled himself among the leaders of the popular party and
became a conspicuous and active member of public meetings, and of
the several revolutionary committees. For some time after the other
colonies had united in a concert of action against the common enemy,
that of Georgia refused to join them. She stood perched upon the
pivot of uncertainty, indeterminate, irresolved and doubting. Some
of her noblest sons had become shining lights in the glorious cause,
the fire of patriotism was extending, oppression was increasing, and,
at length, the cry of blood was heard from Lexington. The work was
done. Like a lion roused from his lair, Georgia started from her
lethargy and prepared for the conflict. She resolved “to do or die.”</p>

<p>On the 2nd of February, 1776, Mr. Gwinnett was appointed a member
of the Continental Congress, and took his seat in that venerable
body on the 20th of the ensuing May. Although his constituents
were now determined to maintain their rights at all hazards, the plan
of independence was to the most of them more than problematical; a
thing of visionary fancy, merely ideal, and not to be hoped for, much
more not to be seriously attempted. The subject, however, gained
new strength daily, and began to emerge from its embryo form. At
this juncture, the Rev. Mr. Zubly, a colleague with Mr. Gwinnett,
with an Iscariot heart, wrote a letter to the royal governor of Georgia,
disclosing the contemplated measure, a copy of which was in some
way obtained by one of the clerks and placed in the hands of Mr. Chase,
who was proverbial for boldness, and who immediately denounced
the traitor on the floor of Congress. The Judas at first attempted a
denial by challenging his accuser for the proof, but finding that the
betrayer had been betrayed, he fled precipitately for Georgia, in order
to place himself under the protection of the governor, who had just
escaped from the enraged patriots and was safely ensconced in a British
armed vessel in Savannah harbour, and could render him no aid
on terra firma. He was pursued by his colleague, Mr. Houston, but
upon the wings of guilt he flew too rapidly to be overtaken.</p>

<p>When the proposition came before Congress for a final separation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
from the mother country, Mr. Gwinnett became a warm advocate of
the measure, and when the trying hour, big with consequences, arrived,
he gave his approving vote and affixed his signature to the important
document that stands acknowledged by the civilized world
the most lucid exposition of human rights upon the records of history—the
Declaration of American Independence.</p>

<p>In February, 1777, Mr. Gwinnett took his seat in the convention
of his own state, convened for the purpose of forming a constitution
and establishing a republican form of government. His activity in
Congress, to which he stood re-elected, had already given him great
weight, and he at once exercised a powerful influence in his new situation.
He submitted the draft of a constitution which, with a few
slight amendments, was immediately adopted by the convention.
Shortly after this he was elevated to the presidency of the provincial
council, then the highest station in the state, thus rising within a
single year from private life to the pinnacle of power in the colony.
At this time an acrimonious jealousy existed between the civil and
military authorities. At the head of the latter was General M’Intosh,
against whom Mr. Gwinnett had pitted himself the preceding year,
whilst in Congress, as a candidate for brigadier-general, and was unsuccessful.
His elevation and influence became a source of uneasiness
to his antagonist. The civil power claimed the right to try military
officers for offences that General M’Intosh conceived were to be
tried only by a court-martial. Another root of bitterness between
these two gentlemen took its growth from the promotion of a senior
lieutenant-colonel, then under General M’Intosh, to the command of
his brigade, destined for the reduction of East Florida, agreeably to a
plan formed by Mr. Gwinnett, which proved a disastrous failure.
This was a source of mortification to the one, and the other publicly
exulted in the misfortune. Under the new constitution a governor
was to be elected on the first Monday of the ensuing May, and Mr.
Gwinnett offered himself as a candidate. His competitor was a man
whose talents and acquirements were far inferior to his, but succeeded
in obtaining the gubernatorial chair. General M’Intosh again publicly
exulted in the disappointments that were overwhelming his antagonist—a
challenge from Mr. Gwinnett ensued—they met on the
blood-stained field of <em>false</em> honour—fought at the distance of four paces—both
were wounded, Mr. Gwinnett mortally, and died on the 27th of
May, 1777, the very time he should have been in Congress. Comment
is needless—reflection is necessary.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_44">WILLIAM ELLERY.</h2>
</div>

<p>The sacredness of contracts honourably and fairly entered into by
parties competent to make and consummate them, should be held in
high veneration by all. The individual and the social compact from
the co-partnership of the common business firm up to the most exalted
nation, are bound by the laws of God, of man and of honour to
keep inviolate their plighted faith. A deviation from the path of
rectitude in this particular, is uniformly attended with evil consequences
and often with those of the most direful kind. The party
that violates its engagements without accruing causes of justification,
and to advance its own interests regardless of those of the other,
comes to court with a bad cause. I have repeatedly remarked, that
the American revolution was produced by a violation on the part of
the mother country of chartered rights secured to the colonists by
the crown under the British constitution.</p>

<p>To enter into a full exposition of the relations between the two
high contracting parties, would require more space than can be allowed
in this work. A reference to some of the prominent points in a
single charter, will give the reader an idea of the nature of the whole
as originally granted, although some of a later date are rather more
limited in their privileges than that of Rhode Island, to which I
refer.</p>

<p>This charter secured religious freedom, personal liberty, personal
rights of property, excluding the king from all interference with the
local concerns of the colony and was virtually democratic in its features.
One of the early acts of parliament, referring to Rhode Island,
contains the following language. “That no person within the said
colony at any time hereafter shall be in any way molested, punished,
disquieted, or called in question for any difference of opinion in matters
of religion that does not actually disturb the civil peace of the
said colony.” The feelings of the inhabitants from the time they received
their charter up to the time oppressions were commenced by
Great Britain, may be inferred from the following extract taken from
the ancient records of the secretary of state of that province addressed
to the king. “The general assembly judgeth it their duty to signify
his majesty’s gracious pleasure vouchsafed to us,” &amp;c.; and also
from the following extract of a letter written at a later period to Sir
Henry Vane then in England. “We have long drunk of the cup of
as great liberties as any people we can hear of under the whole
heavens. We have not only been long free together with all English
from the yokes of wolfish bishops and their popish ceremonies,
against whose grievous oppressions God raised up your noble spirit
in parliament, but we have sitten down quiet and dry from the
streams of blood spilt by war in our native country. * * * We have
not known what an excise means. We have almost forgotten what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
tythes are, yea, or taxes either to church or common weal.” In addition
to other declaratory acts of parliament, sanctioning and construing
chartered privileges generally in all the colonies, one was passed
in March, 1663, involving the very hinge upon which the revolution
turned, as the following extract shows. “Be it further enacted, <em>that no
taxes shall be imposed or required of the colonies, but by the consent of
the general assembly</em>,” meaning the general assembly of each colony
separately and collectively. This single sentence of that act, based
upon the British constitution and guarded by the sanctity of contracts
that could not be annulled but by the mutual consent of the high contracting
parties, solves the whole problem of the revolution. Living
as the colonists did in the full enjoyments of these chartered privileges
which had become matured by the age of more than a century,
they would have been unworthy of the name of men, had they tamely
submitted to their annihilation. To the unfading honour of their
names let it be said—<em>they did not submit</em>. A band of sages and
heroes arose, met the invaders of their rights, and drove them from
Columbia’s soil.</p>

<p>Among them was <span class="smcap">William Ellery</span>, a native of Newport, Rhode
Island, born on the 2nd of December, 1727. His ancestors were
from Bristol, England. He was the son of William Ellery, a graduate
of Harvard College and an enterprising merchant, who filled many
public stations, among which were those of judge, lieutenant-governor,
and senator. Delighted with the docility of his son, he became his
instructor and superintended his studies preparatory to his entrance
in college. After these were completed, William entered Harvard
College and became a close and successful student. He became delighted
with the Greek and Roman classics and dwelt with rapture
upon the history of the ancient republics. So great was his veneration
for the ancient authors, that he continued to be familiar with
them during his whole life, and became a lucid philologist in classic
literature. At the age of twenty he took the degree of bachelor of
arts, and then commenced the study of law. In that laborious field
he was all industry and diligence, and was admitted to practice with
brilliant prospects before him. Located in one of the pleasantest
towns on the Atlantic, surrounded by a large circle of friends who
desired his success, blessed with superior talents, improved by a refined
education, esteemed by all who knew him, his situation was
truly flattering. He possessed an agreeable and amiable disposition,
a strong mind, enlivened by a large share of wit and humour, an urbanity
of manners of a refined and polished cast, and an animation
and life in conversation that dispelled ennui from every circle in which
he moved. He was of the middle stature, well formed, with a large
head, an intelligent and expressive countenance, moderate in his
physical movements, and with all his vivacity generally wore a grave
aspect. He was temperate, plain, and uniform in his habits and
dress, and could seldom be induced to join in the chase after the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ignus fatuus</i> of fashion. For many years before his death, his wardrobe
bespoke a man of another generation.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellery commenced business in his profession at his native town,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
took to himself a wife, soon became eminent and obtained a lucrative
practice. He was highly honourable in his course and gained the
confidence of his fellow citizens and of the courts. Up to the time
of the commencement of British oppression, his days passed peacefully
and quietly along and a handsome fortune accumulated around
him. When the revolutionary storm began to gather, the mind of
Mr. Ellery became roused and a new impetus was given to his physical
powers. His townsmen were the first among the colonists who
had dared to beard the lion and unicorn. On the 17th of June, 1769,
in consequence of the oppressive conduct of her captain, the revenue
sloop Liberty, belonging to his Britannic majesty, and then lying at
Newport, was forcibly seized by a number of citizens in disguise,
who cut away her masts, scuttled her, carried her boats to the upper
part of the town, and committed them to the flames under the towering
branches of a newly planted liberty tree. This was a hard cut
and thrust at the revenue system that contemplated taxing the colonies
contrary to the letter of the constitution and charters granted by
the laws of England. This act was followed by another on the 9th
of June, 1772, in which blood was spilt—that of seizing and burning
the British schooner Gaspee. This was made a pretext for more
severe measures on the part of the hirelings of the crown, and a disfranchisement
of the colony was recommended and urged upon parliament.
Already was the revolutionary ball in motion. In the
midst of these turmoils, Mr. Ellery was not an idle spectator. He
declared for the cause of liberty and the preservation of those rights
that had become sacred by age and had the high sanction of the laws
of nature, of man, and of God. In 1774, he was warmly in favour
of the project of a general Congress, and, in conjunction with Governor
Ward, who was a delegate with Mr. Hopkins to that august assembly,
approved of a suggestion already made in a letter from General
Greene, “that the colonies should declare themselves independent.”
The same spirit soon became general in the province.</p>

<p>In 1776, Mr. Ellery was elected a member of the Continental Congress,
and proceeded to the post of duty boldly and fearlessly, left
by his constituents to act as free as mountain air. He had participated
in all the incipient measures of the conflicts in his own colony,
he now became a vigorous and active patriot of the national legislature.
He was fully prepared to sanction, and well qualified to advocate the
Declaration of Independence. An agreeable speaker, master of satire,
sarcasm, logic, and philosophy, he exercised a salutary and judicious
influence. He was an able member of committees and was immediately
placed upon some of great importance. He was upon the
committee for establishing expresses, upon that for providing relief
for the wounded and disabled, upon that of the treasury, and upon
the committee of one delegate from each state for the purchase of
necessaries for the army. He was also upon the marine committee,
and was a warm advocate for the navy. His constituents were many
of them bold mariners, and he felt a just pride in referring to his fellow-citizen,
commodore Ezek Hopkins, of Rhode Island, as the first
commander of the little fleet of the infant Republic. It was him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
who took New Providence by surprise, seized a large amount of munitions
of war, one hundred pieces of cannon, and took prisoners the
governor, lieutenant-governor, and sundry others of his majesty’s
loyal officers. When the time arrived for the final question upon that
sacred instrument which was to be a warrant of death or a diploma
of freedom, Mr. Ellery was at his post, and most cheerfully gave it
his sanctioning vote and approving signature. With his usual vivacity,
he placed himself by the side of Charles Thomson, the secretary, for
the purpose of observing the apparent emotions of each member as
he came up and signed the important document. He often recurred
to this circumstance in after life, and observed, that “undaunted resolution
was displayed in each countenance.” He was continued a
member of Congress until the close of the session of 1785, which
shows how highly his services were valued by the patriotic citizens of
his native state. In 1777, he was one of the important committee of
admiralty, the committee for replenishing the empty treasury, the committee
upon commercial affairs, of the one to investigate the causes
of the surrender of Ticonderoga, and of the one for preventing the
employment in the public service of persons not clearly in favour of
the American cause. He ably advocated the plan, supposed to have
originated with him, and submitted by the admiralty committee, of fitting
out six fire-ships from Rhode Island to annoy the British fleet.</p>

<p>When the enemy obtained possession of Newport their vengeance
against this patriot was manifested by burning his buildings and destroying
all his property within their power. This only increased his
zeal in the glorious cause of liberty and scarcely disturbed the equanimity
of his mind. In 1778, he advocated strongly a resolution
making it death for any member of the colonies, <em>alias</em> tories, who
should betray or aid in delivering into the hands of the enemy any of
the friends of the revolution, or give any intelligence that should lead
to their capture. He also supported the plan of confederation adopted
by Congress. He spent nearly his whole time in that body.</p>

<p>The ensuing year he was one of the committee on foreign relations,
which at that time involved the unpleasant duty of settling some difficulties
that existed between the United States foreign commissioners,
in addition to the usual diplomatic affairs with foreign nations. He
was also chairman of a committee to provide provisions for the inhabitants
that were driven from the island of Rhode Island and were entirely
destitute of the necessaries of life. The ensuing year he was
arduously employed upon most of the standing committees, especially
the admiralty committee, the duties of which became very delicate,
as the powers claimed by some of the states conflicted with those of
the general government under the articles of confederation. A committee
was created for the express purpose of defining those powers,
of which he was the prominent member. Their deliberations resulted
in the determination that all disputed claims were subject to an appeal
from the court of admiralty to Congress, where the facts as well
as the law were to be finally settled. On all occasions and in all
situations he was diligent, punctual, and persevering. In the house,
whenever he discovered any long faces or forlorn countenances, even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
in view of the darkest prospects, his wit and humour were often so
vivid as to dispel the lowering clouds that hung gloomily over the
minds of dejected members.</p>

<p>In 1782, he was an efficient member of the committee on public
accounts, the duties of which had become not only of great magnitude,
but of a very perplexing character. Fraud and speculation had
rolled their mountain waves over the public concerns, and to do justice
to all who presented claims, was no common task. In 1783,
Mr. Ellery had the pleasure of being appointed by Congress to communicate
to his friend, General Green, a resolution of thanks and
high approbation for his faithfulness, skill and services, accompanied
by two pieces of brass cannon taken from the British at the battle
of the Cowpens.</p>

<p>In 1784, he was a member of the committee appointed to act upon
the definitive treaty with Great Britain. He was also upon the one
for defining the power of the board of the treasury, the one upon
foreign relations, and the one upon the war office. The next year he
closed his congressional course, and, as the crowning glory of his arduous
and protracted labours in the national legislature, he advocated
with great zeal, forensic eloquence, and powerful logic the resolution
of Mr. King for abolishing slavery in the United States. His whole
force of mind was brought to bear upon this subject and added a
fresh lustre to the substantial fame he had long enjoyed. He then
retired to his now peaceful home, to repair the wreck of his fortune
and enjoy the blessings of that liberty for which he had so ardently
contended. In the spring of 1786, he was appointed by Congress
a commissioner of the national loan office for Rhode Island, and
shortly after, he was elected to the seat of chief justice of the supreme
court of his native state. Upon the organization of the federal government
under the constitution, President Washington appointed him
collector of customs for Newport, which station he ably filled until
he took his tranquil departure to another and a brighter world. The
evening of his life was as calm and mellow as an Italian sunset. Esteemed
by all, he enjoyed a delightful intercourse with a large circle
of friends. Honest, punctual and circumspect, he enjoyed the confidence
of the commercial community in his official station, as well
as the approbation of all in the private walks of life. During the
thirty years he was collector of customs, a loss of only two hundred
dollars upon bond accrued to government, and upon that bond he had
taken five sureties.</p>

<p>He spent much of his time in reading classic authors, and in maintaining
an extensive correspondence with distinguished men. But
three weeks before his death, he wrote an essay upon Latin prosody
and the faults of public speakers. His bible was also a favourite companion,
from which he drew and enjoyed the living waters of eternal
life. Always cheerful, instructive and amusing, his company was a
rich treat to all who enjoyed it. His writings combined a sprightliness
and solidity rarely exhibited. His courtesy and hospitality were
always conspicuous, the whole frame-work of his character was embellished
with all the rich variety of amiable qualities, uniting beauty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
with strength, which can never fail of gaining esteem, and of rendering
an individual useful in life and happy in death. His demise was
as remarkable as it was tranquil. It was that of a christian and philosopher.
On the 15th of February, 1820, he rose as usual in the
morning and seated himself in the flag bottom chair which he had
used for fifty years, and which was a relic rescued from the flames
when his buildings were consumed. He commenced reading Tully’s
Offices in his favourite, the Latin, language, without the aid of glasses,
the print of which is as small as that of a pocket bible. On his way
to the hospital, the family physician called in, and perceiving that his
countenance was cadaverous, felt his wrist and found that his pulse
was gone. The physician administered a little wine, which revived
the action of the purple current. The doctor then spoke encouragingly,
to which Mr. Ellery replied—“It is idle to talk to me in this
way, I am going off the stage of life, and it is a great blessing that I
go free from sickness, pain, and sorrow.” Becoming extremely weak,
he permitted his daughter to help him on his bed, where he sat upright,
and commenced reading Cicero de Officiis, with as much composure
as if in the full vigour of life. In a few moments, without a
groan, a struggle, or a motion, his spirit left its tenement of clay, his
body still erect with the book under his chin, as if on the point of
falling asleep.</p>

<p>Thus usefully lived and thus peacefully died, <span class="smcap">William Ellery</span>.
His whole career presents a rare and pleasing picture of biography,
upon which the imagination gazes with admiration and delight, and
which cannot be rendered more beautiful or interesting by the finest
touches of the pencil of fancy, dipped in the most lively colours of
romance and fiction.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_45">LYMAN HALL.</h2>
</div>

<p>Decision, tempered by prudence and discretion, gives weight to
the character of a man. The individual who is always or uniformly
perched upon the pivot of indetermination, and fluttering in the wind of
uncertainty, can never gain public confidence or exercise an extensive
influence. Decision, to render us truly useful, must receive its momentum
from the pure fountain of our judgment, and not depend upon
others to fill the lamp of philosophy, after our reasoning powers have
become matured by experience, reflection and the solar rays of science.
When the child becomes a man, he should think and act as a
man, and draw freely from the resources of his own immortal mind.
He may enjoy the reflective light of others, but should depend upon
the focus of his own, rendered more brilliant by reflectives, to guide
him in the path of duty and usefulness, that leads to the temple of
lasting fame. The man who pins his faith upon the sleeve of another,
and does not keep the lamp of his own understanding trimmed and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
burning, is a mere automaton in life, never fills the vacuum designed
by his creation, and, when he makes his exit from the stage of action,
leaves no trace behind, no memento to tell that he once moved upon
the earth in the sphere of usefulness, or bore the image of his God.</p>

<p>The sages of the American revolution have left bright and shining
examples of self-moving action and a discreet decision of character.
Among those who were roused to exertion by the reflections of their
own mind, was <span class="smcap">Lyman Hall</span>, who was born in Connecticut in 1731.
He graduated at Yale College at an early age, studied medicine, married
a wife before he arrived at his majority, removed to Dorchester,
S.&nbsp;C., in 1752, and commenced the practice of physic. After residing
there a short time he joined a company of about forty families, originally
from the New England states, and removed to Medway, in the
parish of St. John, Georgia, and settled under favourable circumstances.
He became a successful practitioner, and was esteemed and
admired for his prudence, discretion, clearness of perception and
soundness of judgment, united with refinement of feeling, urbanity of
manners, a calm and equable mind, a splendid person, six feet in
height, an intelligent and pleasing countenance and a graceful deportment.
He had only to be known to be appreciated. As years rolled
peacefully along, Dr. Hall became extensively and favourably known.
He took a deep interest in the happiness of those around him, and in
the welfare of the human family. He was an attentive observer of
men and things and of passing events, and understood well the philosophy
of human rights and the principles of the tenure by which the
mother country held a jurisdiction over the colonies. When the rightful
bounds of that jurisdiction were transcended, he was one of the
first to meet the transgressors and point his countrymen to increasing
innovations. As dangers accumulated, his patriotism became fired
with enthusiastic zeal, tempered by the purest motives and guided by
the soundest discretion. The indecision and temporizing spirit of
Georgia, at the commencement of the revolution, has been before described.
This was extremely annoying to Dr. Hall, but only tended
to increase his exertions in the work of political regeneration. Over
the people of his own district he exercised a judicious and unlimited
influence. He also attended the patriot meetings held at Savannah,
in July, 1774, and in January of the ensuing year, and contributed
much to aid and strengthen his co-workers in the good cause, then
but just commenced. His constituents became equally enthusiastic
in favour of liberty, and indignant at British oppression, with himself.
All the other colonies had united in the defence of their common country
against the common enemy. A frontier settlement, and more exposed
than any other in the province, he prudently laid the whole matter
before the people of his district, and left them to choose freely whom
they would serve. They decided against the sovereignty of Baal and
declared for liberty. They at once separated from the other parishes,
formed a distinct political community, applied to be admitted into the
confederation entered into by the other colonies, passed resolutions of
non-intercourse with Savannah, only to obtain the necessaries of life,
so long as it remained under royal authority, and organized the necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
committees to carry these patriotic and decisive measures into
effect. Placed upon an eminence like this, they were welcomed into
the general compact, and in March, 1775, Lyman Hall was elected
to the Continental Congress to represent the parish of St. John, that
stood like an island of granite in the midst of the ocean, separate and
alone, regardless of the waves of fury that were foaming around her.
This example had a powerful influence upon the other parishes,
and from this lump of the leaven of freedom the whole mass became
impregnated, and, in July following, Dr. Hall had the proud satisfaction
of seeing his province fully represented by men honest and
true, save Judas Iscariot, alias Zubly. Georgia now rose like a lion
when he shakes the dew from his mane for the fight, and “shed fast
atonement for its first delay.” To Dr. Hall may be justly attributed
the first impetus given to the revolutionary ball in the district of his
adoption. As an enduring monument of praise to the portion of the
district in which he resided, which was formed into a new county in
1777, it received the name of <span class="smcap smaller">LIBERTY</span>.</p>

<p>On the 13th of May this devoted patriot took his seat in that august
assembly that then attracted the attention of the civilized world. He
was hailed as a substantial and devoted friend of the cause of human
rights, and immediately entered upon the important duties of his station,
enjoying the full fruition of the light of patriotism that illuminated
that legislative hall. He was a valuable man upon committees, and
although not a frequent speaker, he was heard, when he did rise, with
deferential attention. He reasoned closely and calmly, confining
himself to the point under consideration, without any effort to shine
as an orator. His known patriotism, decision of character, purity of
purpose and honesty of heart, gave him a salutary influence that was
sensibly felt, fully acknowledged and discreetly exercised. He gained
the esteem, respect and confidence of all the members.</p>

<p>In 1776 he took his seat in the national legislature, and became decidedly
in favour of cutting loose from the mother country. He had
induced his own district to present an example in miniature, which
stood approved, applauded and admired. He knew the justice of the
cause he had espoused—he believed Providence would direct its final
accomplishment—he was fully convinced that the set time had come
for his country to be free. With feelings like these, he hailed the
birthday of our independence as the grand jubilee of liberty. He
cheerfully joined in passing the mighty Rubicon, aided in preparing
the sarcophagus of tyranny, signed the certificate of the legitimacy of
the new-born infant and responded heartily to its baptismal name—<span class="smcap smaller">FREEDOM</span>.</p>

<p>Dr. Hall was continued in Congress to the close of 1780, when he
took his final leave of that body, and in 1782 returned to his own state
to aid in systematizing the organization of her government. In common
with many of the patriots, the enemy had devastated his property
and wreaked a special vengeance upon his district. His family had
been compelled to fly to the north for safety, and depend upon the
bounty of others for their support and comfort. In 1783 he was elected
governor of Georgia, and contributed largely in perfecting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
superstructure of her civil institutions and in placing her on the high
road to peace and prosperity. This done, he retired from the public
arena and settled in Burke county, where he once more was permitted
to pursue the even tenor of his ways and enjoy the highest of all earthly
pleasures—the domestic fireside, surrounded by his own family. He
glided down the stream of time calmly and quietly until 1790, when
he bade a last farewell to the transitory scenes of earth, entered the
dark valley of death, and disappeared from mortal eyes, deeply mourned
and sincerely lamented by his numerous friends at home, and by
every patriot in his country. His name is perpetuated in Georgia by
a county being called after him, as a tribute of respect for his valuable
services.</p>

<p>The examples of this good man are worthy of imitation. Without
the luminous talents that tower to the skies in a blaze of glory that
dazzles every eye, he rendered himself substantially and extensively
useful. He was like a gentle stream that passes through a verdant
mead, producing irrigation in its course without overflowing its banks.
Decision of character, prudence of action and discretion in all things,
marked his whole career. Not a stain tarnishes the lustre of his
public fame or his private character. He lived nobly and died peacefully.</p>

<hr />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_46">JOHN PENN.</h2>
</div>

<p>A federal republican form of government is an unlimited partnership
of the purest, noblest character. Based upon an equality of original
stock, an equality of interest in the welfare of the firm devolves upon
each individual of the compact. Unlike monopolizing corporations,
each stockholder has an equal right to act, speak and vote upon all
questions in primary meetings, without reference to the number of
accumulative shares one may hold above another. The specie of the
firm consists in equality of representation, equality of natural rights,
equality of protection in person and property, and equality of personal
freedom. These precious coins cannot be diminished in quantity, or be
reduced in quality by alloy, without courting danger. To aid in preserving
them in their native purity, is the duty of <em>all</em>, not of a <em>few</em>.
Separately and collectively, the great mass belonging to the compact
is obligated to look to its prosperity, and use their best exertions in
promoting the general good. Each one is bound to bring every talent
into use, and to leave none buried in the dark quarry of ignorance,
the quagmire of negligence, or the rust of inertness. The steward
that had but one talent, was condemned because he had not put it to
use. But who can tell what his talents are, until he brings them to
the light? Rich ores often lie deep. Many men have arrived to, and
others passed their majority, moving in a sphere not above mediocrity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
in point of intellect developed, and have then risen like a blazing
comet and illuminated the world. By several of the signers of the
declaration of rights, this position was fully and beautifully demonstrated.</p>

<p>Among these was <span class="smcap">John Penn</span>, a native of Caroline county, Virginia;
born on the 17th day of May, 1741. He was the only child of
Moses Penn, who married Catharine, the daughter of John Taylor.
The education of the son was neglected by the parents, who sent him
to none but the commonest of common schools, which unfortunately
for the youth of the neighbourhood, were the only kind then in that
vicinity. A <em>little</em> learning has been called a dangerous thing, but the
quantum taught in some common schools even at this enlightened age,
is too small to be dangerous, too limited to do much good. As a redeeming
trait in their neglect of duty towards their son, they taught
him by example and precept, social virtue and moral honesty. Upon
the retirement of a farm and in its cultivation young Penn plodded
along with his father, who had no books of value or a desire for them,
until he arrived at the age of eighteen, when his paternal guardian died,
and left him a competence, but not a large fortune. About that time
he became inclined to read, this inclination ripened, his mind began
to expand and his thirst for knowledge increased. Destitute of a
library, he communicated his ardent desire to improve his education
to Edmund Pendleton, a neighbour and relation of his, who was an
accomplished scholar, a profound lawyer and an able statesman.
Convinced that Mr. Penn possessed strong native talent he made
him welcome to his valuable library and became deeply interested in
his improvement. After exploring the fields of science for a short
time, this young philomath commenced the study of law, and soon exhibited
mental ores, taken from his long neglected intellectual quarry,
that were of a rich and rare variety.</p>

<p>He surmounted the barriers that lay before him with an astonishing
rapidity, and before some of his friends supposed he had mastered
the elementary principles of Blackstone, he presented himself at the
court for examination, was admitted to practice, and at once exhibited
the bright plumage of a successful lawyer and an able advocate. But
three years before, his now soaring talents were buried deep in their
native quarry, unknown and unsuspected; a strong admonition to the
reader, if under similar circumstances, to examine closely the powers
of his own mind. The professional eminence of Mr. Penn rose as
rapidly as his appearance at the bar was unexpected. He gained the
confidence of the community, the respect of the courts, and the esteem
of his senior brethren. In 1763, he added to his original stock in
the firm of the social compact by leading to the hymeneal altar the
amiable and accomplished Miss Susannah Lyme, thus avoiding the
hyemal frost that creeps chillingly over the lonely bachelor.</p>

<p>In 1774, Mr. Penn removed to North Carolina, and carrying with
him a high reputation as a lawyer, soon obtained a lucrative practice.
He had also participated largely in the patriotic feelings that were
spreading over the colonies like fire in a praire, relative to the oppressions
of the mother country. He had imbibed fully the principles of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
his venerable preceptor and friend, who was among the boldest of the
bold Virginians in the vindication of chartered rights, and was a member
of the Congress first assembled at Philadelphia. His liberal
views and splendid talents did not escape the notice of his new
acquaintances. On the 8th of September, 1775, he was appointed a
member of the Continental Congress, to supply the vacancy occasioned
by the resignation of Mr. Casewell. He repaired to the post of honour
and of duty the next month, and became an active and vigorous member
of that venerated assembly of sages, whose wisdom, sagacity,
and intelligence emblazoned the historic page with a lustre before
unknown. He served on numerous committees, and acquitted himself
with great credit in the discharge of every duty that devolved
upon him. In the committee room, in the house, among the people,
in every situation in which he moved, he made the cause of liberty his
primary business. So highly were his services appreciated by his constituents,
that they continued him in Congress until the accumulating
dangers that hung over his own state induced him to decline a
re-election at the close of 1779. He was an early and warm supporter
of the declaration of rights, and when the joyful day arrived to take
the final question, he most cheerfully sustained the measure by his
vote and signature; thus enrolling his name with the brightest constellation
of illustrious statesmen that ever illuminated a legislative hall,
surpassing all Greek, all Roman fame.</p>

<p>South Carolina had been devastated by Lord Cornwallis, who had
dispersed the army under General Gates; and North Carolina was
next to be visited by the conquering foe. Emissaries from the British
were already within its precincts to prepare the way for the entry of
his lordship. Already had the friends of royal power received instructions
to seize the most prominent whigs and the military stores,
with an assurance of immediate support. The cruelties that had been
practised in South Carolina spread a terror over all “but hearts of
oak and nerves of steel.” The sacrifice of Colonel Hayne at Charleston,
will give the reader some idea of the spirit of revenge that actuated
some of the British officers.</p>

<p>When that city fell into his possession, Lord Cornwallis issued a
proclamation, promising all who would desist from opposing the
authority of the king the most sacred protection of person and property,
on condition that each should sign an instrument of neutrality, which,
by legal construction, whilst it put its signers under an obligation not
to take up arms against the mother country, exonerated them from
serving against their own.</p>

<p>Being a prisoner and separated from his wife and six small children,
then residing in the country and surrounded by the small pox, Colonel
Hayne, with his mind long poising on the pivot of uncertainty as to
what was his duty, finally, with great reluctance, signed the fatal instrument
upon the assurances and solemn promises of the English
officers, and James Simpson, intendant of the British police, that he
never should be required to support, with his arms, the royal government.
Colonel Hayne, like Bishop Cranmer, subscribed to that which
his soul abhorred and detested, that he might be permitted to fly to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
the relief of his suffering family. And, as in the case of Cranmer, his
enemies persecuted him the more, and never gave him any peace until
their vengeance was wreaked upon him by inflicting an ignominious
death, in violation of all law, justice and humanity.</p>

<p>Soon after his return to his wife and children, he was called upon
by the British to take up arms against his country and kindred, and
threatened with close confinement in case he refused to comply with
the order. In vain he referred them to the conditions upon which he
so reluctantly signed the article of neutrality. In vain he claimed protection
under the militia law that imposed a fine where a citizen chose
not to render personal service. To his relentless oppressors, all was
a dead letter. He then pointed them to the partner of his bosom, the
mother of his children, sinking under the small pox, and fast approaching
the confines of eternity. In vain he endeavoured to excite their
sympathy or move their compassion. In a few short hours, Mrs.
Hayne took her departure to “that country from whose bourne no
traveller returns,” “where the wicked cease from troubling and the
weary are at rest.” Upon her own couch, peaceful and serene, she
closed her eyes in death. A different fate was in reserve for Colonel
Hayne. His foes still pursued him, and by their own breach of good
faith, and of the contract of neutrality before entered into, absolved
him from its obligations. It was no longer binding upon him, and he
again entered the continental army, preferring death rather than
enter the ranks of the invaders of his country. A short but brilliant
career awaited him. He was soon made prisoner, and was sent to
Charleston, where Lord Rawdon loaded him with irons, submitted him
to a mock trial, exparte in its proceedings and determinations, based
upon revenge and cruelty, resolved on the death of his victim, and that
without delay. Colonel Hayne was doomed to be hung. This sentence
produced amazement and dismay, indignation and surprise amongst
all classes of people. The finest feelings of sympathy were excited
in the breasts of a large proportion of the adherents of the crown, who
deemed the transaction a species of murder. A petition, headed by
the king’s governor and numerously signed by persons of high standing
and advocates for the mother country, was presented to Lord
Rawdon in behalf of the unfortunate prisoner—but all in vain.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Fell revenge sat brooding on his dark and sullen brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the grim fiends of hell urged his soul on to murder.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The ladies of Charleston, the wives and daughters of both whigs and
tories, next united in a petition, couched in the most moving language,
praying that the life of Colonel Hayne might be spared. This met with a
cold reception and a prompt refusal. As a last effort to rescue the
father from the scaffold, his infant children, dressed in their mourning
habiliments, were led before Rawdon, and on their knees, their cheeks
bathed in tears, implored him, with all the thrilling and heart-rending
eloquence of childish innocence, to spare their only surviving parent
and earthly protector.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“But still he stood unmoved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard as the adamantine rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark as a sullen cloud before the sun.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
So melting was this scene that veteran soldiers could not refrain
from weeping, and all were astounded at the cruel severity of the unyielding
and blood-thirsty Rawdon.</p>

<p>A request was then made that Colonel Hayne might be permitted to
die as a military officer, instead of being hung as a felon. This was
also denied.</p>

<p>As a devout Christian, the martyr resigned himself to his cruel fate,
and prepared his mind to meet the approaching crisis. His youthful
son was permitted to visit him in prison, who, when he beheld his
father bound in irons, burst into tears. “Why,” said the father, “will
you break my heart with unavailing sorrow? Have I not often told
you that we came into this world but to prepare for a better? For that
better life, dear boy, your father is prepared. Instead of weeping,
rejoice with me that my troubles are so near an end. To-morrow I
set out for immortality. When I am dead, bury me by the side of
your mother.” No pen can fully describe that scene. When summoned
to the place of execution, his firmness was worthy of the Christian,
the hero, and the patriot. When upon the fatal drop, with the
accursed halter around his neck, he shook hands with his friends,
bade them an affectionate farewell, urged them to persevere in the
glorious cause of freedom, recommended his children to the protection
of three gentlemen present, and the next moment was struggling in
death. The sight was too much for his son, his brain became disordered,
his reason fled, and he soon died insane, lisping his father’s name
to the last moment of his life.</p>

<p>Fortunately for North Carolina, the efficient and sagacious Greene
and his brave officers and soldiers, checked the triumphant and murderous
career of the British army. The operations of this brave
general were greatly accelerated by the exertions of Mr. Penn. In
1780, when Lord Cornwallis penetrated the western part of the state
to Charlottetown, the crisis became awfully alarming, and this bold
patriot was placed at the helm of public affairs in the state, and invested
with almost unlimited power. He was authorized to seize
supplies by force, and to do all things that in his judgment were necessary
to repel the approaching foe. He proved himself equal to the
emergency. He understood his duty, and performed it efficiently and
with so much prudence that no complaints of injustice were heard,
and the state was saved from the grasp of a merciless foe. Tarleton
was humbled, Ferguson killed, and Cornwallis retreated.</p>

<p>Mr. Penn, after discharging the public duties imposed upon him by
his own state, again retired to private life and the pursuit of his profession.
In 1784, he was appointed receiver of taxes for North Carolina;
a high encomium upon his reputation for honesty and integrity.
Fatigued with public service, he resigned this office in a few months
after. This closed his public career, and he bade farewell to the busy
and perplexing scenes of political life, decked with a civic wreath,
surmounted with an unfading and permanent fame. He again entered
into the enjoyments of domestic felicity, which were soon exchanged
for those of another and a brighter world. In September, 1788, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
was gathered to his fathers and laid in the silent tomb, there to await
the resurrection of the great day.</p>

<p>In all the relations of private life and public action the examples
of Mr. Penn are worthy of imitation. As a lawyer he stood pre-eminent.
His forensic eloquence was admirable and strongly pathetic.
The court and jury were often suffused with tears when listening to
his appeals, and his own feelings of sympathy were not always suppressed
on such occasions. As a patriot and statesman he stood approved
and applauded by his country. His disposition was mild,
benevolent and amiable, but firm in the performance of every duty.
He was an honest man. Let every reader imitate <span class="smcap">John Penn</span> in the
effort to become useful, and banish the doctrine <em>that merit is to be
monopolized by a few</em>, which should never gain credence in a government
like ours, where every individual is equally interested in the
first and dearest principles of freedom—personal rights equally enjoyed
and personal liberty equally secured.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_47">ELBRIDGE GERRY.</h2>
</div>

<p>That man who moves only within the circumference of self, reflecting
no social rays upon the community in which he moves, contributing
in no way to the advancement of human happiness, winding
himself up in the hermitical cocoon of a miser’s cell or of total seclusion
from the world, makes his life a vacuum and his death a burletta.
The acutest metaphysician can never demonstrate the problem of his
creation, the lemma of his existence has no corollary in philosophy.
The following apothegm from <span class="smcap">Elbridge Gerry</span> should be deeply impressed
upon the mind of every reader: “It is the duty of every citizen,
though he may have but one day to live, to devote that day to the
service of his country.” This precept he enforced by the examples of
his brilliant career.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elbridge Gerry</span> was a native of Marblehead, Massachusetts, born
on the 17th of July, 1744. He was the son of an enterprising and
respectable merchant, who bestowed upon him a classical education.
He graduated at Harvard University in 1762, with a scholastic and
mental reputation creditable to himself and pleasing to his friends.
Judging the tree by its fruit, the seed from which it sprang must have
been of the purest kind, and its vegetation not retarded by the absorbing
and poisonous weeds of vice. Its incipient pruning and growth
must have been directed by a master hand, to produce a form of so
much symmetry and beauty.</p>

<p>After having completed his collegiate studies, Mr. Gerry entered
the counting-house of his father and ultimately became one of the
most enterprising and wealthy merchants of his native town. From
the nature of his business he was among the first to feel the weight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
of the impolitic and unconstitutional revenue system, and by the nature
of his mind, he was impelled to meet oppression at the threshold.
A man of deep reflection and investigation, he examined closely the
nature and extent of chartered rights and of British wrongs. He made
himself acquainted with the structure and principles of government,
law, political economy, and national policy. No one understood
better than him, the natural, legal and practical relations between the
mother country and the colonies. He was therefore prepared to act
advisedly and disposed to act firmly. His extensive influence, his
decision of character, his sound discretion and his exalted patriotism,
pointed him out as one of the master spirits to guide the public mind
and aid in the public affairs of the people. He at once became a participant
in all the popular movements in favour of liberty. On the
26th of May, 1773, he commenced his official career as a member of
the legislative body of Massachusetts Bay, then called “the general
court.” That assembly and the royal governor took a bold issue upon
rights and wrongs. The unconstitutional acts of parliament were
sanctioned by the latter, and fearlessly censured by the former. The
general court, moved by Samuel Adams, appointed a standing committee
of inquiry for the purpose of watching closely the proceedings
of ministers and parliament, and of corresponding with the other colonies
upon the important subjects then under national consideration.
This committee was appointed two days after Mr. Gerry had taken
his seat for the first time in a legislative body, of which he was made
a member. From that time forward he was a conspicuous actor upon
the tragic stage of the revolution, in the drama of peace and in the
construction of the federal government. He walked shoulder to
shoulder with Adams and Hancock in the adoption of the bold measures
that roused the lion from his lair and the people to their duty.
At the Boston tea-party, the opposition to the port bill, the impeachment
of the crown judges, the controversy with Governor Hutchinson
and the establishment of non-intercourse with Great Britain, Mr.
Gerry stood firmly at his post. Completely prostrated in his influence,
and driven from every position assumed, Governor Hutchinson
retired and was succeeded by General Gage. This change was of no
advantage to the royal cause. The blending of military and civil
power was an unpopular measure. He issued a commission for a
new general court, but finding it would be composed of members
inimical to his views he countermanded the order. The sovereign
people, however, elected delegates, who assembled in October at
Salem, an unusual place of meeting, to do the business of their constituents.
The governor and council not appearing to administer
the oath of office, they adjourned to Concord and organized a provincial
Congress, of which Mr. Gerry was a leading member. They prepared
an address to the governor in respectful but firm language, declaring
their attachment to the mother country, and their willingness
to obey all laws of parliament and the mandates of the king that came
within the sacred pale of the British constitution and the well defined
charters which had emanated from it. They pointed out the violations
of right, the perversions of justice, the military array of foreign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
soldiers, all tending to reduce the people to slavery. They reasoned,
they explained, they remonstrated, but all in vain. These appeals to
Governor Gage fell upon his adamantine soul as the morning dew
upon the desert of Sahara. The delegates then appealed to the legitimate
source of a righteous government—<span class="smcap">the people</span>—who nobly responded
and sustained them in the hour of peril. They then proceeded
to adopt measures for the vindication of their inalienable rights, and
whilst they presented the olive branch of peace they prepared for
war. Severe measures were adopted by parliament, the charter of
Massachusetts was altered by exparte legislation under the crown,
illegal taxes were imposed, the hirelings of the king became more insolent,
the indignation of the people rose like a tornado, colonial
blood began to flow, the tocsin of war was sounded, the clash of arms
and fury of battle commenced, the struggle was terrific, the lion was
conquered—<span class="smcap">America was free</span>!!</p>

<p>During all the thrilling scenes that passed in Massachusetts previous
to his election to Congress, Mr. Gerry was a leading member of
the legislative body from its aurelia form to its more perfect growth.
He was an active and efficient member of the two great committees
that were for some time virtually the government—the committee of
safety and that of supplies.</p>

<p>In April, 1775, he narrowly escaped the grasp of his foes. The
night previous to the battle of Lexington, Messrs. Gerry, Lee and
Orne were at Cambridge, through which the British passed on their
way to the opening scene of hostilities. When they arrived opposite
the house where these gentlemen were in bed, a file of soldiers suddenly
separated from the main body and approached it rapidly. The
patriots barely escaped by the back way in their linen as the enemy
entered, not having time to put on a single article of their over-dress.
After the military passed on they returned for their wardrobe, and
immediately rallied the people to prepare for resistance.</p>

<p>The night previous to the fall of his intimate friend, the brave
Warren, Mr. Gerry lodged in the same bed with him. The anxiety
they felt for their country drove sleep from them, and their time was
spent in concerting plans for future action. The lamented hero of
Bunker Hill appears to have had a presentiment of his premature fate.
The last words he uttered to Mr. Gerry as they parted were,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Dulce et decorum est,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pro patria mori.”<a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D"></a><a href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_D" href="#FNanchor_D" class="fnanchor">D</a> It is sweet and glorious to die for one’s country.</p></div>

<p>In the month of July, 1775, the government of Massachusetts assumed
a systematic form. A legislature was chosen and organized,
and in a few months a judiciary was established upon the basis of the
new arrangement. Mr. Gerry was immediately appointed to the responsible
post of judge of the admiralty court, but declined serving,
preferring more active and exciting duties. He desired to be where
he could render the most important services.</p>

<p>On the 18th of January, 1776, he was elected to the Continental
Congress, a situation he was well calculated to fill. Bold and fearless,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
yet cautious and prudent, he was admirably adapted to meet
the awful crisis of that eventful era. His public reputation already
established on a lofty eminence, he was placed upon the most important
committees, and among others upon the one sent to head-quarters
to consult with Washington and mature plans of supplies for the
army and for its augmentation. To the speculating sutlers and to
peculating contractors, he was a terror during the war. He introduced
in Congress many salutary guards against dishonest men, who,
during a war more especially, always hang about every department
of government like vultures. Even now, in a time of profound peace,
they occasionally tap the jugular vein of our republic, and produce a
laxity of the sinews of power.</p>

<p>When the declaration of independence was proposed in Congress,
the soul of Mr. Gerry was enraptured in its favour. He had long
been prepared for the measure and gave it his ardent support. When
the thrilling moment arrived for final action upon this important question
his vote was recorded in favour of equal rights, and his signature
affixed to that venerated instrument which verified the truth of divine
prophecy—“A nation shall be born in a day.”</p>

<p>In 1777, he was still continued a member of the national council,
and continued to discharge his duty with unabated zeal. The committee
rooms and the house were alike benefitted by his intelligence
and extensive experience in general business. He was called to aid
in the arrangement of the military hospitals, the discipline and regulations
of the army, the commissary department, foreign commerce,
and other branches of the new government, requiring the soundest
discretion to place them on a firm basis. He was also associated with
Messrs. Clymer and Livingston on their mission to the army to arrange
existing difficulties. He took a conspicuous part in the debates
upon the articles of confederation, and was listened to with great attention.
He spoke well, reasoned closely and demonstrated clearly.</p>

<p>Like Mr. Clymer, he was truly republican in all his ideas and opposed
to every thing that did not bear upon its face sound sense,
practical usefulness and equality of operation. Hence he opposed
a resolution of thanks proposed in Congress to his bosom friend, Mr.
Hancock, for his services when he resigned the presidential chair.
He contended that the president had done no more than to ably perform
his duty, the rest of the members had done the same, and it
would be a singular entry upon the journals of Congress to record a
vote of thanks to each. Etiquette, however, prevailed over his logic,
and the usual vote of thanks was passed, thus introducing a custom
in the new government that has long since lost its original importance
by too frequent use on occasions of minor interest.</p>

<p>Mr. Gerry was also upon the committee that devised the plan of
operations for the northern army that effectuated the capture of
Burgoyne, and upon the one to obtain supplies for the American
troops during the winter of 1777, which took him again to the camp
of Washington. These multiform and arduous duties, so constantly
imposed upon him, are stronger encomiums upon his talents, perseverance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
patriotism, and activity, than a volume of panegyric from
the most enlivening pen that was ever wielded by mortal hand.</p>

<p>I have repeatedly referred to the religious and moral characters of
the members of the Continental Congress as remarkable for purity.
As a proof of the assertion, the records of that body of the proceedings
of the session of 1778, show a resolution passed recommending
the several states to adopt decisive measures against “theatrical entertainments,
horse-racing, gaming, and such other diversions as are
productive of idleness, dissipation, and a general depravity of principles
and manners.” Another resolution strictly enjoins upon the
officers of the army “to see that the good and wholesome rules provided
for the discountenancing of profaneness and vice, and the preservation
of morals among the soldiers, are duly and punctually preserved.”
A third one was passed, which would be a <em>sweeper</em> if
revived at the present day. It arose from a disposition on the part
of some officers to disregard the first one above cited. It reads as
follows.</p>

<p>“Resolved, that any person holding an office under the United
States, who shall act, promote, encourage, or attend such plays, shall
be deemed unworthy to hold such office, and shall be accordingly
dismissed.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gerry voted for these resolutions, which were passed by a
large majority. He was upon the grand committee of one from each
state, appointed during that session, to examine closely foreign affairs
and the conduct of the foreign commissioners, about which considerable
difficulty then existed, particularly relative to Mr. Deane. The
committee used the probe freely, and recommended to Congress to
use the amputating knife upon every limb affected by the gangrene
of political corruption. The report of the committee was an able
document and produced a warm debate, in which Mr. Gerry participated
and supported it with great eloquence and force.</p>

<p>On the 14th of October, 1779, he proposed to Congress the expedition
against the Indians, which was successfully executed by General
Sullivan. He also proposed a resolution designed to guard against inducements
to corrupt influence, that “no candidates for public office
shall vote in, or otherwise influence their own elections; that Congress
will not appoint any member thereof during its time of sitting,
or within six months after he shall have been in Congress, to any office
under the said states, for which he, or any other for his benefit, may
receive any salary, fees, or other emolument.” He urged it strongly
but was unsuccessful. As a member of the committee of finance
Mr. Gerry stood next in rank to Robert Morris.</p>

<p>In 1780, he retired from Congress after five years arduous and
faithful service. In all situations and at all times, he was energetic,
zealous and active in the cause of liberty. When his duties called
him to the army, if any fighting was on the tapis whilst he was in
camp, he always insisted upon taking an active part. When the
affair occurred with General Howe at Chestnut Hill, he actually
shouldered a musket and entered the ranks; and when General Kniphausen
engaged the American army at Springville, he took his station<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
by the side of Washington, who invested him with a volunteer command
during his stay. On both of these occasions he was one of the
visiting committee from Congress.</p>

<p>The second year after his retirement, he was again induced to become
a member of the national legislature and commenced his duties
with the same zeal that had marked his whole career. The business
of the nation was at that time more perplexing than when in the heat
of the revolution. An empty treasury, a prostrate credit and a
mammoth debt, presented a fearful contrast. To aid in settling the
derangement in public affairs, he was an important member. Committee
labours were heaped upon his shoulders as though he was an
Atlas and could carry the world, or an Atalanta in the celerity of
business. The local feelings and interests of the states began to be
perplexing, and the half pay for life guaranteed by Congress to all
officers who remained in the army during the war, was a source of
dissatisfaction with many. This was finally settled by compounding
the annuity for the full pay of five years.</p>

<p>In 1784, he was chairman of the important committee on foreign
relations, and of the one to perform the onerous task of revising the
treasury department. He also brought forward a resolution for the
compensation of Baron Steuben, who had rendered immense service
by introducing a system of military tactics and discipline, by which
the armies of the United States were entirely governed, and which
were strictly adhered to long after the revolution by the military
throughout the union. This resolution was warmly supported by
Mr. Jefferson, but owing, as I fondly hope, to the embarrassed situation
of the financial department, it was lost. He also took a deep interest
in the commerce of the republic, a subject which he understood
well.</p>

<p>In 1785, Mr. Gerry closed his services in the Continental Congress.
During that year he was arduously employed upon the committee
on accounts. He also obtained the passage of his former resolution
relative to public officers and elections and the appointment
of members of Congress to office. At the close of the session he
retired from public life for a season and settled at Cambridge, not
far from Boston, with all the honours of a pure patriot and an able
statesman resting upon him—crowned with the sincere and lively
gratitude of a nation of freemen.</p>

<p>Time soon developed to the sages of the revolution that the articles
of confederation which bound the colonies together when one common
interest and impending dangers created a natural cement, were not
sufficient to secure permanently the liberty they had achieved. Local
interests engendered jealousies, these produced dissatisfaction, and
this threatened to involve the government in anarchy. To remedy
these evils, a motion was made by Mr. Madison, for each state to send
delegates to a national convention for the purpose of forming a constitution.
The proposition was sanctioned, and in May, 1787, the
convention commenced its herculean task at the city of Philadelphia,
in the accomplishment of which Mr. Gerry took an active and
useful part. He was among those who did not sanction or sign the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
instrument as adopted, and participated liberally in the political
abuse of the <em>partisans</em> who were opposed to him, not by the noble
minded statesmen who differed with him in opinion, all honest in
their views and patriotic in their motives. <em>They</em> soared above the
acrimonious scurrility of venal party spirit.</p>

<p>After the constitution was adopted, no one manifested more zeal
in adhering to it than Mr. Gerry; actuated, as on all other occasions,
by the great republican principle—<em>that the majority must rule and be
obeyed</em>. He was elected a member of the first Congress under it, and
did much towards raising the beautiful superstructure that now towers
sublimely upon its broad basis. After serving four years he declined
a re-election and again sought retirement. But this was of short
duration. The relations between America and France had become
deranged and threatened a disastrous result.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams, then president of the United States, determined on
sending an able embassy to that government, and to make a strong
effort to effect an amicable arrangement of difficulties before appealing
to arms. General Pinckney was already appointed an ambassador to
France. Mr. Gerry and Mr. Marshall, since chief justice of the United
States, were appointed to join him in this delicate duty of diplomacy,
empowered to act separately or collectively, as a sound discretion
should dictate. On their arrival at Paris they were not treated with
proper courtesy by the directory, and were not recognised as the official
organ of their nation. Prudence and patience were necessary to
prevent an immediate rupture between the two countries. They opened
a correspondence with the French secretary of foreign affairs, and
after many fruitless attempts to be met in a proper manner, Messrs.
Pinckney and Marshall were ordered peremptorily to depart from the
republic of France, and Mr. Gerry invited to stay. By his prudent,
manly and firm course, he succeeded in allaying the angry feelings of
the French nation, and prevented a war that for a long time seemed
inevitable.</p>

<p>On his return he was placed upon the republican ticket as a
candidate for governor of Massachusetts. Party spirit at that time
was in its full vigour, and the federal party had for a long time
been in the majority. So popular was Mr. Gerry, that his antagonist,
Mr. Strong, was elected but by a small majority, and that resulted
from the incorrectness of some of the returns, the former having actually
received the largest number of votes. In 1805 he was upon
the electoral ticket which succeeded. In 1810 he was elected governor
of his state by a large majority, and ably discharged the duties of
chief magistrate. He had never entered into <em>partisan</em> feelings and
views, and in his first message pointed out, in a luminous manner, the
dangers arising from high toned party spirit, and did all in his power
to allay it. He felt and acted for his whole country and the general
good. This deterioration from <em>party</em> caused him to lose his election
for the next term; the leaders of each having marshalled their forces
in solid phalanx—the federal party, when consolidated, having always
had a majority in the state since its distinctive formation.</p>

<p>For many years Mr. Gerry had anxiously desired to be excused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
from the public duties of high and responsible stations, but no excuse
was accepted. In 1813 he was inaugurated vice-president of the
United States, and proceeded to discharge the devolving duties with
great dignity and propriety. His impartiality, correctness and candour
gained for him the esteem of the elevated body over which he
presided to the last day of his eventful and useful life—thus teaching
by example the principle of his precept, that “It is the duty of every
citizen, though he may have but one day to live, to devote that day to
the service of his country.”</p>

<p>At the city of Washington a beautiful monument is erected to his
memory, with this inscription:</p>

<p class="p1 center">
The tomb of<br />
<span class="larger">ELBRIDGE GERRY,</span><br />
Vice-President of the United States,<br />
Who died suddenly in this city, on his way to the<br />
Capitol, as President of the Senate,<br />
November 23d, 1814,<br />
Aged 70.
</p>

<p class="p1">In the review of the life of Elbridge Gerry the pure patriot finds
much to admire and nothing to condemn, unless a man is to be condemned
for an honest difference of opinion and for keeping aloof from
high toned party spirit, which, for the sake of liberty, God forbid. His
examples of devotedness to the good of his country, his untiring industry,
his prudence, his discretion, his intelligence, and his moral
virtues, are all worthy of imitation and shed a lustre upon his character.
In private life he was highly esteemed and fulfilled its duties
with the strictest fidelity. He was emphatically a useful man in every
sphere in which he moved. No perils retarded him from the faithful
performance of what he deemed duty. His purposes were deliberately
formed and boldly executed. He was an honour to his country,
to the cause of freedom, and to enlightened liberal legislation.
He was truly a worthy and an honest man.</p>

<p>Every man is not designed by creative wisdom to become a Demosthenes
or a Cicero; but every man of common sense has the power
to be good and to render himself useful. If all were alike gifted with
splendid talents, the monotony would become painful, and variety,
the very spice of life, would lose its original flavour. If <em>all</em> our statesmen
were eloquent orators and were affected by the mania of speech-making,
as sensibly as most of our public speakers are at the present day,
we should be constantly, as we are now frequently, overwhelmed with
talk and have but little work finished. No one admires eloquence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
more than the writer, but the speedy accomplishment of business is
of higher importance. Like our bodies that end in a narrow cell, the
speeches of our legislators, although based upon the purest motives,
dictated by the most enlightened understanding, decked with the beauties
of intelligence, strengthened by the soundest logic and embellished
with the richest flowers of rhetoric, receive their final fate from the
approving <em>Aye</em>—or the emphatic <em>No</em>. I indulge no desire to extinguish
these brilliant lights, or to snuff them too closely. The volume of
their flame, often so large as to emit smoke, might safely be diminished
and their wicks cut shorter. Brevity is the soul of wit, prudent
despatch, the life of business. In the committee-room every man
can be useful—the responsibilities of a vote bear equally upon each
at the time and place he is called to act. Let the importance of no
man be undervalued by himself or his compeers because he is not born
with a trumpet tongue. If his head is clear and his heart right, <em>he can
do good</em>.</p>

<p>Some of the most useful members of the Continental Congress seldom
participated in debate, and the ablest speakers were remarkable
for conciseness and for keeping close to the question under consideration.
Among those who rendered essential services in the cause of
the revolution, in a retiring and unassuming manner, was <span class="smcap">William
Paca</span>, a native of Wye Hall, on the eastern shore of Maryland, born
on the 31st of October, 1740. His father was a highly respectable
and influential man, and bestowed upon William a good education,
and planted deeply in his mind the principles of virtue and moral rectitude.
He completed his classical studies at the college in Philadelphia,
and in 1758 commenced the study of law at Annapolis. Industrious
in his habits, and not fond of the public gaze, he applied himself
closely to the investigation of that science which unfolds the nature
and duty of man in all the relations of life, shows what he is and what
he should be under all circumstances, unveils his passions, his propensities
and his inclinations, carries the mind back through the abysm
of times of light, of shadows, of darkness and of pristine happiness,
and illuminates the understanding more than either branch of the sciences,
it being a compound of the whole in theory and in practice.
An honest and upright lawyer, who is actuated alone by principles of
strict justice, pure ethics, equal rights and stern integrity, can do
more to sustain social order and promote human happiness than a man
pursuing either of the other professions.</p>

<p>Upon principles like these Mr. Paca commenced his practice, and
upon a basis like this he built an enduring fame. He was esteemed
for his clearness of perception, honesty of purpose, decision of character,
prudence of conduct and substantial usefulness—all exhibiting a
clear light, but not a dazzling blaze or an effervescent embrocation.
Upon minds like his, the oppressions of the mother country made a
gradual impression, that was deepened by the graver of innovation,
and that all the powers of earth could neither efface, deface, erase nor
expunge. Thus it was with Mr. Paca—as chartered rights and constitutional
privileges were more openly infringed by the British authorities,
his soul became more strongly resolved on liberty or death.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
He was on intimate terms with Mr. Chase, who possessed all the requisites
to command, while Mr. Paca possessed the indispensable
acquisitions of a safe and skilful helmsman. With qualities thus differing,
but with the same object in view, these two patriots commenced
their voyage upon the boisterous ocean of public life, at the same time
and place.</p>

<p>Soon after he became a member of the bar Mr. Paca was elected a
member of the legislature of Maryland, and discharged his duties to
the entire satisfaction of his constituents. In 1771 he was one of the
committee of three that prepared a letter of thanks from the citizens
of Annapolis to Charles Carroll for his able advocacy of the cause of
liberty, in a written controversy with the royal governor and his
lackeys. In that letter the committee expressed a determination
never to submit to taxation without representation, or to the regulating
of taxes by executive authority—thus fully approving and sustaining
the position taken by the distinguished citizen whom they addressed.</p>

<p>Mr. Paca was a member of the Congress that convened at Philadelphia
in 1774, which rendered itself illustrious by proceedings of
propriety and wisdom, such as would naturally flow from a mind like
his. It is upon such men that we can always safely rely in times of
peril and danger. They view every thing in the calm sunshine of
reason and justice, and are never overwhelmed by the billows of foaming
passion or sudden emotion. Always upon the terra firma of prudence,
and always prepared for action, they are ready to render assistance
to those whose more towering barks often get among the breakers.</p>

<p>Mr. Paca was continued a member of Congress until 1778, and
rendered valuable services upon numerous and important committees.
In 1775 he was a member of the one charged with providing ways and
means to ward off the threatened dangers that hung frightfully over
the cause of freedom in Virginia and North Carolina. He was also
upon a similar committee for the aid of the northern department.
About that time he joined Mr. Chase in furnishing a newly raised
military corps with rifles, to the amount of nearly a thousand dollars,
from their own private funds. His talents, his time and his fortune
he placed in the fearful breach of his country’s freedom. His examples
had a powerful influence upon the minds of his reflecting friends,
who had unlimited confidence in his opinions, always deliberately
formed.</p>

<p>When the declaration of independence was proposed, his feelings
and views were decidedly in its favour, but his instructions from the
assembly of Maryland were directly opposed to the measure. The
members of that body considered the project as wild and futile, believing
the power of the mother country sufficient to crush all opposition.
They only contemplated redress—this they fondly but vainly
hoped for. The course of the British authorities, however, soon furnished
arguments, steeped in blood, that convinced them of the necessity
of the course proposed in Congress, and about the first of July,
1776, they removed the injunction and left Mr. Paca and his colleagues
to act freely without any restraint. The struggle between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
the adherents of the crown and the patriots in the assembly had been
severe. The able letters written by their delegates in the national
legislature had great weight in the colonial council, and the affair
at Lexington admitted of no extenuation. The first decided vote in
favour of the cause, then in embryo, obtained in the Maryland legislative
body, was on the 28th of May preceding the declaration, when
their chaplain was directed to omit praying for the king. This was a
sore cut upon the dignity of his majesty, and, as trifling as it may
seem, had a potent effect upon the people. It convinced them that if
the king had forfeited all claims to the <em>prayers</em> of his subjects, he was
not pure enough to direct their destinies, and with one accord declared,
“we will not have this man to rule or reign over us.”</p>

<p>When the glorious 4th of July, 1776, arrived, Mr. Paca was in his
place, fully prepared to sanction the Magna Charta of American freedom
by his vote and signature, and enrolled his name among the great
apostles of <span class="smcap smaller">LIBERTY</span>, whose fame will continue to rise in peerless majesty
until the last trump of time shall sound its final blast and the
elements be dissolved in fervent heat.</p>

<p>On his retirement from Congress, in 1778, Mr. Paca was appointed
chief judge of the superior court of Maryland, and in 1780 his duties
were increased by the appointment of chief judge in prize and admiralty
cases. He had proved himself an able statesman—his talents
as a judicial officer shone with equal brilliancy. The acumen of his
mind and his legal acquirements made him an <em>able</em> judge, his honesty
and impartiality rendered him a <em>popular</em> one. He was a man of
polished manners, plain but dignified in his deportment and graceful
in his address, with an engaging, intelligent and benignant countenance,
all combining to gain admiration.</p>

<p>In 1782 he was elevated to the gubernatorial chair of his native
state. As chief magistrate he sustained a high reputation for usefulness
and sound policy. He was a devoted friend to literature and
religion, and did much to promote their prosperity. He inculcated the
principles of political economy and governed the state with a parental
care. His wise and judicious course furnished no food for malice,
was above the assaults of slander, and afforded jealousy no loop to
hang upon. After completing his term he retired to private life, until
1786, when he was again called to preside over the destinies of his
native domain.</p>

<p>In 1789 he was appointed by President Washington, United States
district judge for the Maryland district, which office he continued to
fill with dignity and respect until 1799, when he was summoned by
death to appear before the dread tribunal of the great Jehovah to render
an account of his stewardship. His life had been that of a good
man, his final end was peaceful and happy. Let his memory be revered
and his examples imitated. He demonstrated most clearly that
moderation and mildness, tempered with discretion and firmness,
govern better and more potently than angry and authoritative dictation.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_49">GEORGE ROSS.</h2>
</div>

<p>I have frequently referred, in several of the preceding biographies,
to the powerful eloquence of several of the Signers of the Declaration
of Independence. Of its nature, the reader should be correctly
informed.</p>

<p>Rhetoric, as taught in the schools, as defined in the lexicons, and
as practised in times of prosperous peace and leisure like the present,
is not the kind that graced the Continental Congress.</p>

<p>Not to leave the reader to depend upon a picture drawn by my
own fancy and imagination, I will present the delineation as drawn
by those who saw and felt its influence, at the time it illuminated the
legislative hall, roused men to deeds of noble daring, and gave freedom
to our happy country.</p>

<p>One of the illustrious members of that body, John Adams, has
said: “Oratory, as it consists in expressions of the countenance, graces
of attitude and motion, and intonation of voice, although it is altogether
superficial and ornamental, will always command admiration,
yet it deserves little veneration. Flashes of wit, corruscations of imagination
and gay pictures, what are they? Strict truth, rapid reason,
and pure integrity, are the only essential ingredients in oratory. I
flatter myself, that Demosthenes, by his ‘action! action! action!’
meant to express the same opinion.”</p>

<p>Another eminent writer, who had often felt the force of this, the
kind of eloquence exhibited by the sages of the revolution, in describing
that of the illustrious statesman just named, remarked; “It was
bold, manly, and energetic, but such as the crisis required. When
public bodies are to be addressed on momentous occasions, when
great interests are at stake, and strong passions excited, nothing is
valuable in speech farther than is connected with high intellectual
endowments. Clearness, force and earnestness are qualities which
produce conviction. True eloquence, indeed, does not consist in
speech. It cannot be brought from far. Labour and learning may
toil for it, but they toil in vain. Words and phrases may be marshalled
in every way, but they cannot compass it. It must exist in the man,
in the subject, and in the occasion. Affected passion, intense expression,
the pomp of declamation, all may aspire after it, but they
cannot reach it. It comes, if it comes at all, like the outbreaking of
a fountain from the earth, or the bursting forth of volcanic fires, with
spontaneous, original, native force. The graces taught in schools, the
courtly ornaments and studied contrivances of speech, shock and disgust
men when their own lives, and the lives of their wives and
children, and their country, hang on the decisions of the hour. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
words have lost their power, rhetoric is vain, and all elaborate oratory
contemptible. Even genius itself, then feels rebuked and subdued, as
in the presence of higher qualities. Then patriotism is eloquent,
then self-devotion is eloquent. The clear conception outrunning the
deductions of logic; the high purpose, the firm resolve, the dauntless
spirit speaking on the tongue, beaming from the eye, informing every
feature, and urging the whole man onward—right onward to his object—this,
this is eloquence, or rather, it is something greater and
higher than eloquence—it is action, noble, sublime, and god-like
action.”</p>

<p>This was the kind of eloquence that characterized the Continental
Congress, and sounded an alarum that vibrated the souls of millions,
and often drove back the purple current upon the aching heart. No
long, no set, no written speeches were then crowded upon the audience
to kill time and make a show. Governor M’Kean, who was
constantly a member during the revolution, remarked, shortly before
his death, “I do not recollect any formal speeches, such as are made
in the British Parliament, and in our late Congresses, to have been
made in the Revolutionary Congress. We had no time to hear such
speeches, little for deliberation—action was the order of the day.”</p>

<p>Of the kind of eloquence above described, <span class="smcap">George Ross</span> possessed
a large share. This faithful public servant was the son of the Rev.
George Ross, pastor of the Episcopal Church at New Castle, Delaware,
and was born in 1730, at that ancient town. Under the parental
roof, and under the instruction of his father, his strong native talents
unfolded their beauties, and at the age of eighteen he became a good
classical scholar. He then commenced the study of law with John
Ross, an elder brother, in the city of Philadelphia, where he was admitted
to the bar in 1751. In order to have more elbow-room he located
at Lancaster, then a border town near the confines of civilization,
and verging on the “far west.”</p>

<p>Noble in his disposition, agreeable and plain in his manners, learned
and diligent in his profession, candid, honest, and just in his course,
he succeeded in gaining the confidence and esteem of the people, and
a lucrative practice. In addition to all this, in order to plant himself
more firmly in his new location, he married Miss Ann Lawler, an
amiable and highly respectable lady, who proved an affectionate and
worthy companion.</p>

<p>He built his legal fame upon its legitimate basis, close application
to his professional business unconnected with public politics. At the
present day, many young men, unfortunately for themselves, when
they are admitted to the practice of law, at once enter the political
arena, for the purpose of obtaining professional notoriety and business.
This conclusion is based upon false premises, and has prevented many
from rising to a legal eminence that a contrary course would have
gained. Sacred writ has declared, “no man can serve two masters.”
This is particularly the case with a young lawyer at the present day;
the American revolution was a different thing. When he becomes
devoted to the interests of a political party, a tyrant that exacts the
most abject and humiliating services, either <em>his</em> business, or that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
the party must be neglected. Reflecting men know this, and aware
that it requires close study and diligent application to become
learned in the law, they keep aloof from young political lawyers.
A few high toned partisans may employ them in <em>small</em> matters, but
if they have an important case, the studious, industrious attorney,
who has not imbibed the corrupting atmosphere of modern politics, is
the man of their choice. A word to the wise should be sufficient.</p>

<p>It was not until long after his location at Lancaster that Mr. Ross
commenced his legislative course. The time had already arrived
when the people began to feel the smart of British oppression, and
became more particular in selecting men of known worth, integrity
and talents, to guard their interests against the machinations of an
avaricious and designing ministry. They accordingly elected Mr.
Ross a member of the colonial legislature in October, 1768. His
reputation then stood high as an able lawyer and as a man of liberal
views, sound judgment and decision of character. He at once exercised
a salutary influence in the assembly, and took a bold and decided
stand in favour of the people’s rights. At that time it was the
custom of the legislature to reply to the messages of the royal governor
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in extenso</i>, or at large. Mr. Ross was appointed to prepare an
answer to one of these documents at the first session of his service.
In that as at all subsequent times, he boldly objected to every proposition
that he considered impolitic or in opposition to the rights and
best interests of the people. He became a faithful and fearless sentinel,
a vigorous and able champion in the cause of liberty. He continued
to serve in the legislature of his own colony until he was elected
to Congress. He was one of the committee that prepared a consonant
reply to the speaker of the house of burgesses of Virginia in answer
to the resolutions recommending a general convention of delegates
to deliberate upon the condition of the country. In every leading
measure in favour of freedom, he was among the leading men.</p>

<p>In 1774, he was appointed a delegate to the Congress convened at
Philadelphia, and repaired promptly to the post of duty. He was one
of the committee of the assembly that determined on sending delegates
to the general convention, and was appointed by that committee
to prepare the instructions of that body to govern these delegates in
their action. As these instructions are similar in their main features
to those adopted by the other colonies, I here insert them that the
reader may see that peaceable redress of grievances was all that was
at that time contemplated by the sages of the revolution.</p>

<p>“The trust reposed in you is of such a nature, and the modes of executing
it may be so diversified in the course of your deliberations, that
it is scarcely possible to give you particular instructions respecting it.
We shall therefore only in general direct, that you are to meet in
Congress the committees of the several British colonies at such time
and place as shall be generally agreed on, to consult together on the
present critical and alarming situation and state of the colonies, and
that you, with them, exert your utmost endeavours to form and adopt
a plan which shall afford the best prospect of obtaining a redress
of American grievances, ascertaining American rights, and establishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
that union and harmony which is most essential to the welfare and
happiness of both countries. And in doing this, you are strictly
charged to avoid every thing indecent or disrespectful to the mother
state.”</p>

<p>Under instructions like these the first general Congress assembled;
agreeably to instructions like these that august body acted. All
honourable means were used to restore peace on the part of the colonists
that were required by the constitution of England, more was
offered than reason and strict justice demanded. Nothing but an infatuation
making men blind, deaf and dumb, could have resisted the
appeals and consummate arguments in favour of chartered and violated
rights that were poured upon the king, the parliament and the
people of Great Britain, from the deep, the translucent fountain of
intelligence concentrated in the Congress of 1774. The members
were determined to clear their own skirts of blood and not draw the
bow of physical opposition until their arrows were dipped in the liquid
fire of eternal justice and fixed in the quiver of wisdom.</p>

<p>Mr. Ross was continued a member of the Continental Congress
until 1777, when ill health compelled him to retire. He rendered important
services on numerous committees, and was a strong and truly
eloquent debater in the house. He also served, when his congressional
duties would permit, in the legislature of Pennsylvania, in which he
continued to exercise an essential influence. The governor and his
friends were on the alert to thwart the designs of the patriots, and for
some time presented a formidable opposition. To raise the foundation
of this royal mass, Mr. Ross placed his whole weight upon the
political lever, and contributed largely in breaking it up. He was a
member of the colonial convention that commenced the new government,
and one of the committee that prepared the declaration of rights
on that occasion. He was chairman of the committee that formed
the organization of the state government, and of the one that prepared
the declaratory ordinance defining high treason and misprision of treason,
and the kind and measure of punishment to be inflicted. Upon
committees like these, his high legal acquirements rendered him an
important member. He was a profound lawyer and an able statesman,
and well prepared to aid in laying deep the foundations of rational
liberty.</p>

<p>On the 19th of July, 1779, he was appointed judge of the court of
admiralty for Pennsylvania, and in July following was called suddenly
and unexpectedly to witness the untried scenes of a boundless
eternity. His death was occasioned by an excruciating attack of the
gout.</p>

<p>Thus in the full career of life and usefulness, rising on the wings
of fame, flushed with the hopes of liberty for his country, pressing
right onward towards the goal of freedom, an arrow from the quiver
of death pierced his patriotic heart and consigned him to the insatiate
tomb. There his dust reposes in peace whilst the lustre of his examples
when living will continue to shine and will be admired by
millions yet unborn.</p>

<p>Immediately after he closed his legislative career, the citizens of
Lancaster county passed two resolutions of the following tenor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
“Resolved, that the sum of one hundred and fifty pounds out of the
county stock, be forthwith transmitted to George Ross, (‘Honourable’
was not then republican,) one of the members of the assembly for this
county, and one of the delegates for this colony in the Continental
Congress; and that he be requested to accept the same, as a testimony
from this county of their sense of his attendance on the public
business, to his great private loss, and of their approbation of his conduct.</p>

<p>Resolved, that if it be more agreeable, Mr. Ross purchase with part
of the said money a genteel piece of plate, ornamented as he thinks
proper, to remain with him as a testimony of the esteem this county
has for him, by reason of his patriotic conduct in the great struggle
for American liberty.”</p>

<p>Here is old fashioned republican simplicity in language and expression,
flowing from its native fountain—gratitude strongly felt and
plainly told—forming a bold contrast with the fulsome flattery of
modern times showered upon our statesmen by fawning sycophants,
whose gratitude is based alone upon the loaves and fishes of favour
and office.</p>

<p>Mr. Ross declined accepting the gift, assuring the committee that
waited upon him, that he had performed no more than his duty, and
that at such a period all were bound to exert their noblest energies to
secure their liberty, which would afford a reward more precious than
gold, more valuable than diamonds.</p>

<p>In private as in public life, he stood approved and untarnished. No
blemish is upon the proud escutcheon of the name of <span class="smcap">George Ross</span>.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_50">BENJAMIN HARRISON.</h2>
</div>

<p>Moderation, arising from sound discretion and deep penetration of
judgment, united with wisdom to plan, and energy to execute, is always
desirable, and, in times of high excitement, indispensably necessary
in those who wield the destinies of a community. When the
fires of passion burning in the bosoms of an enraged multitude unite
in one cyclopean volume, the mental rod of moderation managed
by skilful hands can alone guide, regulate, and direct it to a proper
destination. To this quality, pre-eminently possessed by many of the
sages of the American revolution, we owe the liberty we now enjoy.
It was this that gave weight and dignity to the proceedings of the
Continental Congress; leaving the mother country without an excuse
for oppression and exciting the sympathy of other nations in favour
of the cause of liberty.</p>

<p>No one demonstrated more fully the beauties of moderation, combined
with firmness of purpose and boldness of action, than <span class="smcap">Benjamin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Harrison</span>. He was the eldest son of Benjamin Harrison, and
born in Berkley, Virginia. The date of his birth is not recorded. His
family descended from a near relation of General Harrison, who was
a bold leader in the revolution of the English commonwealth and was
sacrificed upon the scaffold for his liberal principles. This relation
settled in Surrey, Virginia, about 1640. His descendants sustained
the high character of their ancestors, and filled many important public
stations in the colony, and were uniformly wealthy and liberally educated.
It is recorded of Benjamin Harrison, who was the son of the
Mr. Harrison who settled at Surrey, that “he did justice, loved mercy,
and walked humbly with his God;” thus leaving a memento of character
that forms the crowning excellence of human attainments. The father
of the subject of this narrative was killed by lightning with two of his
daughters. At that time Benjamin was prosecuting his studies at the
college of William and Mary, where he finished his education at an
early age. Before he arrived at his majority he assumed the entire
management of the large estate left him by his father. He shortly
after married Elizabeth, the beautiful and accomplished daughter of
Colonel William Bassett, and niece to the sister of Lady Washington.
He was a man of great muscular power, above the middle height,
graceful but plain in his manners, with an intelligent countenance, indicating
truly strength of mind and decision of character. Towards
the latter part of his life he became corpulent, in consequence of good
dinners and a quiet mind. Before he arrived at the age then required
by law, he was elected a member of the house of burgesses, and soon
became a distinguished leader. His talents were of the peculiar kind
calculated to lead, without an apparent desire to command. His
magic wand was sound discretion deliberately and firmly exercised
on all occasions, enlivened by a good humour and sprightliness that
took off the wiry edge of his otherwise stern qualities; for when his
purposes were fixed, it required a powerful lever to move them—he
adhered to them with a firmness that in a more morose man would
have been called obstinacy.</p>

<p>Wielding a powerful influence, the creatures of the crown were particularly
courteous towards him, especially just preceding the commencement
of the revolution, and proposed to confer upon him the highest
official dignity in the colony, except that of governor, which was always
reserved for a <em>native</em> of the mother country. But Mr. Harrison
was too independent in mind, too republican in principle, and too penetrating
in their designs, to be caught in the silken web of ministerial
intrigue or royal cunning. With all his wealth and influence he was a
plain common sense man, acting upon the principle that modesty is the
handmaid of virtue, and has more charms than the pomp of courts and
the flourish of high pretensions. He was a man of the people, and
went for them and his country. He was too high minded to become
a tool, and scorned to be the slave of a king.</p>

<p>As early as 1764, Mr. Harrison was one of the committee appointed
by the house of burgesses that prepared an address to the throne, a
memorial to the house of lords, and a remonstrance to the house of
commons of Great Britain, predicated upon the Virginia resolutions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
anticipating the contemptible stamp act. These documents were
strong meat in view of a majority of the house, and by the process of
political alchymical chemistry, were transmuted to milk and water.
But the time rolled on that brought with it circumstances that inspired
far different feelings and action. As British oppression increased,
Virginia patriotism and indignation were kindled to a flame that illuminated
the remotest bounds of the old dominion. Harrison, Henry,
Wythe, Randolph, Jefferson and other sons of Virginia were roused.
Mr. Harrison was a member of the convention that met at Williamsburgh
on the first of August, 1774, that passed a series of strong resolutions
in favour of equal rights, and sanctioned the measures of
opposition adopted in New England. The same convention appointed
seven delegates to the Congress to be held at Philadelphia, Mr. Harrison
being one. When the time arrived, he repaired to the post of
duty and of honour. As but one object was contemplated at that time—the
adoption of measures to sustain right, justice and peace, the
session continued but two months, and was entirely employed in preparing
petitions, remonstrances, and addresses, in which Mr. Harrison
aided by his counsels. A personal acquaintance and a free
interchange of personal views, which served to establish mutual confidence,
and to produce a concert of feeling when the time for more decisive
action arrived, appears to have been the greatest good that resulted
from the meeting of that Congress. Its proceedings also placed the
colonies in a favourable light in view of other nations and of reflecting
men, showing that they paid a proper respect to the royal authority
of the mother country, and were unwilling to cut the cord of
allegiance without a just cause. The king and his infatuated counsellors
were left without excuse in their mad career.</p>

<p>On the 20th of March, 1775, Mr. Harrison was a member of the
Virginia Convention that met at Richmond, and passed the bold resolutions
offered by Patrick Henry. A vote of approbation and thanks
was also passed in favour of the delegates that had served in Congress
the preceding autumn. Many had their eyes opened at that time and
came to the rescue of their country.</p>

<p>Lord Dunmore, anticipating the appointment of delegates to a
second Congress, issued his proclamation forbidding the procedure,
at the same time affecting to treat the convention as a mere bagatelle.
But the time had arrived when proclamations from the royal governors
had lost their virtue and were in bad odour. The convention elected
Congressional delegates, among whom was Mr. Harrison.</p>

<p>When he again repaired to his post, a wider field opened for labour.
The proceedings of the preceding Congress had been treated with contumely
by the crown, and an awful crisis had arrived. The cry of
blood resounded from the heights of Lexington, and penetrated the
ears, the heart, the very soul of every patriot.</p>

<p>At the death of Mr. Randolph, the first president of the Continental
Congress, Mr. Hancock was elected to fill his place. When his name
was announced, he seemed overcome with a modest diffidence, and
not proceeding instantly to his post, Mr. Harrison, who was standing
near him, picked him up in his gigantic arms and placed him in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
chair, remarking, “we will show mother Britain how little we care
for her, by making a Massachusetts man our president, whom she has
excluded from pardon by public proclamation.”</p>

<p>Action now became the order of the day. Each gale from the
North wafted tidings of fresh outrages and increasing oppression on
the part of “mother Britain.” Congress began to prepare for the
worst, although many of its members still listened to the syren song
of peace. An important committee was appointed to devise ways
and means for defence, and for organizing the militia throughout all
the colonies that were represented, of which Mr. Harrison was an
efficient member. After labouring arduously for a month, the committee
reported the plan of military operations that carried the
American armies through the revolution. From the fact that Mr.
Harrison was uniformly selected to aid in military operations when
they required the attention of Congress, it may be inferred that he
was well qualified to act in that department. He was on the most
intimate terms with Washington and enjoyed his unlimited confidence,
which is the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ne plus ultra</i> of eulogy upon his character.</p>

<p>In September, he was one of the committee of three appointed to
consult with the commander-in-chief, and with the authorities of the
regenerated colonies, for the means of preparing for vigorous action.
On the 29th of November, he was appointed chairman of the committee
of five to take charge of the foreign correspondence, subsequently
organized and made the committee on foreign affairs. On the second
of December, he was sent to Maryland to aid in organizing a naval
armament to repel the predatory warfare of Lord Dunmore along the
shores of the Chesapeake. On the 17th of January, 1776, he laid before
Congress a plan upon which to predicate the recruiting service,
which was approved. On the 21st of the same month, he was placed
upon the committee to organize the war department, and two days
after, started with Messrs. Lynch and Allen to New York, to aid
General Lee in arranging means for its defence, and for the erection
of fortifications upon the two confluent rivers. On his return he was
placed on the committee for organizing the military departments of
the middle and southern colonies; and on the sixth of March he was
placed on the standing marine committee, bestowing upon him labour
according to his physical as well as mental powers.</p>

<p>On the 26th of March, Congress published a complete preface to
the declaration of independence, setting forth the contempt with
which the petitions, remonstrances, and appeals for redress had been
treated, and portraying in lively colours the constitutional and chartered
rights of the American people, and the manner they were
trampled under foot and steeped in blood by the British hirelings.
The same document authorized the colonies to fit out vessels of war
to meet the mistress of the seas on her own element. At the same
time Mr. Harrison was appointed chairman of a committee to select
and cause to be fortified one or more ports for the protection of these
vessels and such prizes as they might take. In May, he was made
chairman of the committee on the Canada expedition. After consulting
Generals Washington, Gates, and Mifflin, he laid a plan of operations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
before Congress, which was approved. On the 26th of the
same month he was appointed chairman of a committee of fourteen,
directed to confer with the general officers of the army relative to a
plan of operations for the ensuing campaign. When this was matured
he laid it before Congress, and during its consideration was chairman
of the committee of the whole. With some amendments the
report of the committee was adopted. On the 15th of June a board
of war was organized, of which Mr. Harrison became chairman, and
continued to fill this important post until he retired from Congress.
In the discharge of its duties the revered Judge Peters remarks of
him, “He was a member, &amp;c. when I entered upon the duties assigned
me in the war department. This gave me an opportunity of observing
his firmness, good sense and usefulness in deliberation and in
critical situations, and much use indeed, was required of these qualities,
when every thing around us was lowering and terrific.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison became very popular as chairman of the committee
of the whole, and when in the house, uniformly presided when important
questions were under discussion. He was in the chair during
the discussion of the declaration of independence. He also brought
up the resolution of the committee that recommended the formal preparation
of that sacred instrument, and on the fourth of July reported
it as sanctioned by Congress, and sealed his own approbation with
his vote and signature. As a further evidence of his cheerfulness
and good humour under all circumstances, at the thrilling moment
when the members were signing what was by many considered their
death warrant; as Mr. Gerry, who was a light slender man finished
his signature, the robust Mr. Harrison remarked to him, “When the
hanging scene comes to be exhibited, I shall have all the advantage
over you. It will be all over with me in a minute, but you will be
kicking in the air half an hour after I am gone.”</p>

<p>During the protracted discussions upon the articles of confederation,
Mr. Harrison was uniformly in the chair if in the house. From
August until the 5th of November, 1776, he was not a member of
Congress, and was engaged in the service of his own state, having
been appointed one of the counsellors of Virginia under the new form
of government. He then succeeded Mr. Jefferson, and again assumed
the important stations he had before so ably filled. He was also
placed upon the committee to superintend the movements of the
northern army. During the sad reverses of the winter of 1776–7, he
remained firm at his post, whilst many had gone home disheartened
and dejected, but not willing to abandon the cause of freedom. When
Congress was compelled to fly from Baltimore to Lancaster, where
they remained but for a day, and from there to Yorktown, he followed
all its destinies. At one time, at the latter place, the number
of members did not exceed twenty, but these few were rendered
more zealous and strong from this very circumstance. When there
were but twenty-eight, Samuel Adams said it was the truest Congress
ever assembled; and when the number was reduced still lower,
the amount of zeal manifested and labour performed was not diminished.
Its enemies predicted its final dissolution, but proved themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
to be false prophets. They even reported that Mr. Harrison
was about to desert the cause. The moderation of this patriot often
interposed to soften proposed measures that were too hasty and harsh.
When the question was agitated relative to the Quakers, (referred to
in the biography of Mr. Chase,) he interfered in their behalf, and as
one of their number often remarked, “He saved us from persecution.
He had talents to perceive the right and firmness enough to pursue
it however violently opposed.”</p>

<p>At the close of 1777, Mr. Harrison resigned his seat in Congress
and returned to the bosom of his family. No one member had performed
more labour than him, and no one was more highly esteemed
and honoured. He was a colossus in the cause of liberty and human
rights. He was emphatically a powerful working man.</p>

<p>On his return to his constituents he was not permitted to enjoy
repose, but was immediately elected to the house of burgesses, and
on taking his seat, was elevated to the dignified station of speaker,
which he continued to fill for five successive years. During that
period the revolutionary storm rolled its fury over Virginia, which
before had experienced but little inconvenience within its own borders.
Arnold the traitor and Cornwallis the tyrant, were tinging its streams
and saturating its soil with the blood of her noble sons. Fire and
sword, murder and rapine, ruin and destruction, marked their savage
career. The house of burgesses was driven from Richmond to Charlottesville,
to Staunton, and to the Warm Springs, and found but a
transient resting place at either. Application was made to Washington,
but he could afford no relief. During these rapid removes of
the legislature, Mr. Harrison remained firm, and used every exertion
to promote such measures as were best calculated to ward off
impending dangers. He did much to rouse the people to action and
dispel the terrors of their minds. He knew no fugitive fears; the
opinion of another writer to the contrary notwithstanding, uttered
without any foundation in truth, merely to raise his own hero above his
proper level, by climbing upon the shoulders of the towering reputation
of Mr. Harrison. This <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ruse de guerre</i> will not answer even at
this late day. Records speak for the dead in a voice that withers the
slanderer like the hand writing that paralysed the sturdy frame of
Belteshazzer.</p>

<p>In 1782, Mr. Harrison was elected governor of Virginia and assumed
an herculean task. The recent devastations of the British army,
and the efforts of internal enemies, had thrown every thing into one
chaotic mass. He entered upon his duties with an energy and sagacity
that showed no “fugitive fear,” and so well did he succeed, that
he became one of the most popular chief magistrates that ever filled
the gubernatorial chair of Virginia. He was re-elected twice, and
then became ineligible by the constitution, and once more sought repose
in retirement. Immediately after, he was nominated as a candidate
for the legislature without his knowledge, and for the first time
was unsuccessful. His election was defeated by a singular circumstance
that was taken advantage of by his opponent. When governor,
he had directed the militia to level the embankments at Yorktown,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
which was an unpopular measure. Without lamenting his defeat,
effected entirely by intrigue, he removed into the adjoining county of
Surrey, and was returned to the same legislature with his competitor;
and to render his triumph more complete and the mortification of his
opponents more galling, he was elected speaker of the house. Before
the year expired his old constituents solicited him to return to his
former residence. Old age and infirmity began to admonish him to
retire, and he declined a re-election.</p>

<p>In 1788, he was a member of the convention of his state to which
the federal constitution was submitted, and was appointed chairman
of the first committee—that of privileges and elections. He opposed
the document submitted as too indefinite in defining the powers of
the general and state governments, and sanctioned it with certain
amendments that were returned with it. So strong was the opposition
to its adoption by nearly half of the delegates, that they held a
private meeting in the night for the purpose of adopting plans of opposition
that were calculated to produce the most fatal consequences.
Fortunately, the deliberate old patriot, Mr. Harrison, gained admittance
and prevailed upon them to submit to the majority of nine and
pursue the legal remedy for obtaining amendments. This noble and
patriotic act formed the crowning glory of his public career. In 1790
he was nominated chief magistrate, but declined serving, and used his
utmost influence for Mr. Randolph and induced his own son to vote
against him, who was then a member of the house, by which the governor
was elected. Mr. Randolph had become unpopular with a part
of the members, who were confident of defeating him could they prevail
upon Mr. Harrison to consent to be used as a <em>party</em> man.</p>

<p>During the next year his health declined rapidly, and in April,
shortly after his unanimous election to the legislature, he was prostrated
by a severe attack of the gout, which terminated his long and
useful life, leaving a large family of children to mourn the loss of a
kind father, and his country to lament the exit of one of her noblest
patriots. He was the father of General Harrison of Ohio, whose name
is now before the public as a candidate for the next president of the
United States. The private character of this zealous champion of
liberty was without reproach. His wit and humour made him a pleasant
companion, his intelligence and good sense made him an interesting
one. His clear head, good heart, sound judgment and equable
moderation, made him an important public servant, exactly suited to
the times in which he lived.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_51">CÆSAR RODNEY.</h2>
</div>

<p>Genealogy was once an essential part, the first stepping stone of
biography, a kind of titular idol held in great veneration. In countries
where the iron sceptre of monarchy is still swayed, where titles
of honour create lineal dignity without regard to merit, where blood
is analyzed by political chemistry and all the precipitants are rejected
but the carbonate of noble pedigree, where royalty descends upon a
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">non compos mentis</i> incumbent with the same facility that it reaches a
man of good intellect, genealogy is still measurably the criterion by
which to determine the importance and degree of character. As
light and intelligence shed their benignant rays upon mankind, the
importance attached to this titular deity will be diminished. Where
rational liberty reigns triumphant, merit alone creates dignity; the man
is measured by his actions, not by the purple fluid that flows through
his veins. In our free country genealogy is a matter of curiosity, not
of veneration. The son of a coal cracker, or of a cobbler, whose father
may have been a foundling, can rise to the highest station within the
gift of the people by the force of talent and merit. I am aware that
the aristocracy of wealth is a noxious weed that sheds its deleterious
influence around us, but not yet sufficiently strong to prevent genius
from acquiring a rapid and towering growth. In times of danger and
peril its power will be lessened in the same ratio that these increase.
It withers and dies when reached by the magic wand of republican
patriotism. Then “what is a name, my lord?”</p>

<p>One book error is prevalent in our country which should be corrected.
It is predicated upon hereditary notions of blood, and is anti-republican.
Some of our latest writers promulgate the idea that the
criminal conduct of <em>one</em> member of a family disgraces the <em>whole</em>. In
a community purely republican, every individual is judged according
to his or her own deeds, and no act in one can criminate or disgrace
another who is innocent. The very writers amongst us who thoughtlessly
publish this <em>imported</em> sentiment, pursue a different course practically,
and treat others agreeably to their merit, without reference to
the conduct of their relations. Their practice is better than their
theory. But few families in America can trace their ancestors as far
back as the Rodneys of Delaware. This name was introduced into
England with the Norman queen Maud or Matilda, as early as 1141,
and stands among the foremost on the list of military fame acquired
during the Norman conquest and at subsequent periods. To those
who are conversant with the history of the stormy times of that kingdom,
the name of Sir Walter De Rodeney, and others of the same line,
is familiar. They were able in council and in war, they figured in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
civil, military and naval departments, and received the highest honours
that could be awarded to their rank by kings and queens. They were
also remarkable for magnanimity and liberality. Under the auspices
of William Penn, a branch of this ancient family, William Rodney,
came to Philadelphia and finally settled in Kent, Delaware. He was
the son of William Rodney, of England, who married Miss Alice,
daughter of Sir Thomas Cæsar, a wealthy merchant. William Rodney,
who located at Kent, left one son, Cæsar, who was the father of
the subject of this sketch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar Rodney</span> was a native of Dover, Kent county, Delaware,
and born in 1730. He appears to have received a good education,
and at the death of his father inherited an ample fortune in real estate.
He was a slender man physically, with an animated countenance,
easy and pleasing in his manners and gentlemanly in his intercourse.
Owing to a cancer upon his nose, which commenced its ravages upon
him at an early age, he became greatly emaciated, and long before
his death was emphatically a moving skeleton. The cancer having
spread over one side of his face, he was compelled for many years to
wear a silk bandage over it. Notwithstanding this affliction he was
uniformly sprightly and cheerful. With a strong and penetrating
mind, firmness of purpose and decision of character, he united an
abundant share of keen wit and good humour, that rendered him an
agreeable companion—his vast stock of experimental intelligence and
practical knowledge rendered him an instructive one.</p>

<p>With qualities like these Mr. Rodney became a popular public man.
His views were liberal and decidedly republican. In 1758 he became
the high sheriff of his native county, and discharged the duties of his
office with so much ability that he at once gained the confidence and
esteem of his constituents. When his term of service expired he was
appointed a justice of the peace and judge of the lower courts. In
October, 1762, he took his seat in the legislature at Newcastle and
became an active and influential member. He was one of the committee
that prepared the answer to the message of the governor and
was placed on other important committees. At the close of the session
he was put in charge of the great seal to be affixed to such laws
as had been passed.</p>

<p>When the rights of the colonies were threatened by assumptions of
power on the part of the mother country, not warranted by the British
constitution and in violation of chartered privileges, Mr. Rodney was
among the first who took a bold stand in favour of liberty. In conjunction
with Messrs. M’Kean and Kollock he was appointed a delegate
to the Congress that convened at New York in 1765, to remonstrate
against the stamp act and other threatened innovations upon the privileges
of the colonies, that had been long enjoyed and were guarantied
by the social compact between the king and his “dutiful and most
loyal subjects in America.”</p>

<p>After the stamp act was repealed Mr. Rodney was appointed on the
committee with Messrs. M’Kean and Read to prepare an address to
the king expressive of the joy produced throughout the colony by this
event. It resembles those prepared by the other colonies and will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
give the reader an idea of the feelings of loyalty that pervaded the
colonies at that time. The following extract is deemed sufficient for
the present purpose.</p>

<p>“We cannot help glorying in being the subjects of a king that has
made the preservation of the civil and religious rights of his people
and the established constitution the foundation and constant rule of
government, and the safety, ease and prosperity of his people his chiefest
care—of a king, whose mild and equal administration is sensibly
felt and enjoyed in the remotest part of his dominions. The clouds
which lately hung over America are dissipated. Our complaints have
been heard and our grievances redressed—trade and commerce again
flourish. Our hearts are animated with the warmest wishes for the
prosperity of the mother country, for which our affection is unbounded,
and your faithful subjects here are transported with joy and gratitude.
Such are the blessings we may justly expect will ever attend
the measures of your majesty, pursuing steadily the united and true
interests of all your people throughout your wide extended empire,
assisted with the advice and support of a British parliament and a virtuous
and wise ministry. We most humbly beseech your majesty
graciously to accept the strongest assurances that having the justest
sense of the many favours we have received from your royal benevolence
during the course of your majesty’s reign, and how much of our
present happiness is owing to your paternal love and care for your
people, we will at all times most cheerfully contribute to your majesty’s
service, to the utmost of our abilities, when your royal requisitions,
as heretofore, shall be made known: that your majesty will
always find such returns of duty and gratitude from us as the best of
kings may expect from the most loyal subjects, and that we will demonstrate
to all the world that the support of your majesty’s government
and the honour and interests of the British nation are our chief
care and concern, desiring nothing more than the continuance of our
wise and excellent constitution in the same happy, firm and envied
situation in which it was delivered down to us from our ancestors and
your majesty’s predecessors.”</p>

<p>With feelings like these pervading the colonies, the reader must
readily conclude that nothing but the most cruel oppressions could
have driven the American people to a revolution. Connect this address
with the fact of a final separation from Great Britain, and the
imagination is at once supplied with reasons for the declaration of independence,
strong as holy writ—more especially as both documents
emanated from the same statesmen.</p>

<p>Mr. Rodney continued an active member of the legislature for several
years and took a deep interest in all public measures. He introduced
an amendment to a bill relative to slaves, prohibiting the importation
of negroes into the colony. So ably did he support his
amendment that it was lost by a majority of only two votes.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Whom the gods will destroy they first make mad.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>So with the British ministry—they were madly bent on reducing
the American colonies to unconditional subjection, and after a short
interval again commenced a system of oppression upon a broader and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
bolder scale. Once more the people appealed to their king—but
appealed in vain. Mr. Rodney was upon the committee that prepared
the second address to his majesty just before the commencement of
the revolution. The following extract will show the reader the views
of the colonists and the grievances complained of.</p>

<p>“The sense of our deplorable condition will, we hope, plead with
your majesty in our behalf for the freedom we take in dutifully remonstrating
against the proceedings of a British parliament, confessedly
the wisest and greatest assembly upon earth. But if our
fellow subjects of Great Britain, who derive no authority from us,
who cannot, in our humble opinion, represent us, and to whom we
will not yield in loyalty and affection to your majesty, can, at their
will and pleasure, of right give and grant away our property; if they
can enforce an implicit obedience to every order or act of theirs for
that purpose, and deprive all or any of the assemblies on this continent
of the power of legislation for differing with them in opinion in
matters which intimately affect their rights and interests, and every
thing that is dear and valuable to Englishmen, we cannot imagine a
case more miserable—we cannot think that we shall have even the
shadow of liberty left. We conceive it to be an inherent right in
your majesty’s subjects, derived to them from God and nature, handed
down from their ancestors, confirmed by your royal predecessors and
the constitution, in person or by their representatives, to give and
grant to their sovereign those things which their own labours and
their own cares have acquired and saved, and in such proportions and
at such times as the national honour and interest may require. Your
majesty’s faithful subjects of this government have enjoyed this inestimable
privilege, uninterrupted, from its first existence till of late.
They have at all times cheerfully contributed to the utmost of their
abilities for your majesty’s service as often as your royal requisitions
were made known, and they cannot now, but with the greatest uneasiness
and distress of mind, part with the power of demonstrating
their loyalty and affection to their beloved king.”</p>

<p>Addresses similar to this were laid at the foot of the throne from
all the colonies and from the Congress of 1774. The struggle between
filial affection and a submission to wrongs, was of the most
agonizing kind. This, united with the known weakness of the colonies,
renders the American revolution a striking lesson to those in
power, admonishing them not to draw the cords of authority too
closely, and gives encouragement to freemen to resist every encroachment
upon their liberty.</p>

<p>In 1769, Mr. Rodney was chosen speaker of the assembly of Delaware,
and filled the chair for several years with honour and dignity.
As the specks of war began to dim the fair face of freedom he became
one of the most active opposers of British tyranny. He was a member
of the Congress that convened at Philadelphia in 1774, and received
the approbation of his constituents for his firm and patriotic
course. The ensuing year he was again a member of the national
assembly of sages, and took an active part in its duties, deliberations
and discussions. In his own province he had much to do. The royal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
attachments were deeply rooted, and it required great exertions to
counteract the intrigues of foes within, and repel the attacks of enemies
without. In addition to his duties as speaker of the assembly of Delaware
and member of Congress, he was brigadier-general of the militia.
His numerous messages to the legislature, and letters to his officers,
urging them to decisive action, manifest great industry, strength of
mind, clearness of perception, firmness of purpose and patriotic zeal.
He was decidedly in favour of the declaration of independence from
the time the proposition was first laid before Congress. The day previous
to the final question upon this important measure, he was in
Delaware pursuing means to arrest the career of certain tories in the
lower part of the province. Mr. M’Kean informed him by express of
the approaching crisis. He immediately mounted his horse and arrived
at Philadelphia just in time to dismount and enter the hall of
Congress, with boots and spurs, and give his vote in favour of liberty,
and affix his name to that bold instrument that dissolved allegiance
to England’s king, and created a compact of rational freedom.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1776, the tories so far succeeded in obtaining the
reins of power as to prevent the re-election of Mr. Rodney to Congress.
But this only served to increase the exertions of this devoted
patriot. He immediately commenced military operations and repaired
to Princeton, soon after the brave Haslet and Mercer fell in the cause
of justice. He was also an active member of the council of safety.
He remained with the army for two months, and received the high approbation
of the commander-in-chief for his active services in bringing
out the militia and raising recruits. In a letter written to him by
Washington, dated at Morristown on the 18th of February, 1777, is
the following eulogium: “The readiness with which you took the field
at the period most critical to our affairs—the industry you used in
bringing out the militia of the Delaware state—and the alertness observed
by you in forwarding on troops from Trenton—reflect the
highest honour on your character and place your attachment to the
cause in the most distinguished point of view. They claim my sincerest
thanks, and I am happy in this opportunity in giving them to
you.”</p>

<p>On his return to his native state he was appointed a judge of the
supreme court, organized under the new order of things. He declined
serving, believing that he could be of more use to the cause in other
situations. About that time an open insurrection against the new
government broke out in Sussex. He immediately repaired to the
district with a few troops and quelled it at once. At the time the
British forces were preparing to march from the Chesapeake towards
the Brandywine, General Rodney was stationed south of the American
army to watch the movements of the enemy, and if possible to get
between them and their shipping. He exerted his noblest powers to
rouse the militia to their duty, and acquitted himself faithfully in the
discharge of every duty that devolved upon him.</p>

<p>In December, 1777, he was again elected to Congress, but the
legislature of his state being in session, he concluded to remain in that
until the close of its deliberations, during which time he was elected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
president of Delaware, which prevented him from rendering any further
assistance in the national assembly. His services in his new and
dignified station were of the utmost importance in the exposed territory
over which he presided. His exertions in raising supplies for
the continental army were of the most vigorous character, especially
during the winter and spring of 1779, when the troops were much of
the time on half allowance, and the magazines so empty and bare,
that it frequently seemed impossible that the army could be sustained
another week.</p>

<p>During the four years that he presided over the destinies of Delaware,
he had many refractory spirits to manage and many difficult
questions to decide which required the exercise of firmness, prudence
and wisdom. All these qualities were possessed by him. Upon his
own matured judgment he relied. His course was onward towards
the temple of liberty, and so discreetly did he pursue it, that he stood
approved and applauded by every friend of equal rights, and was admired
even by his enemies. He continued to serve his country until
1783, when he fell a victim to the cancer that had been preying upon
him for many years. He met death with calm submission and fortitude,
and died rejoicing in the bright prospects that were opening
upon his country.</p>

<p>From his writings he appears to have highly respected religion and
to have practised the soundest morals. His private character was
unexceptionable and truly amiable. He was partial to good dinners
but not guilty of any excesses. He was remarkably fond of a good
joke, and sometimes exhibited brilliant displays of wit, but was extremely
careful not to give personal offence.</p>

<p>When in Congress, Mr. Harrison, who had often claimed Virginia
as the <em>Dominion</em> of the colonies, asked for immediate aid to protect
her from the invading foe. When he sat down, Mr. Rodney rose,
with assumed gravity and sympathy, and assured the gentleman that
the <em>powerful Dominion</em> should be protected: “Let her be of good
cheer—she has a friend in need—<span class="smcap">Delaware</span> will take her under its
protection and insure her safety.” The portly Harrison and the
skeleton Rodney both enjoyed the “hit,” and the other members were
convulsed with laughter.</p>

<p>His constitutional sympathy was so strong that he always avoided,
if possible, scenes of physical suffering, and could not be induced to
approach the dying bed even of his dearest friend or nearest relative.</p>

<p>To be able to judge correctly of the actions of men, we must understand
the philosophy of human nature thoroughly. We must trace the
circuit of the immortal mind, follow it through the regions of revolving
thought, become familiar with the passions that influence and control
it, learn its natural desires, its innate qualities, its springs of action
and its multifarious combinations. We must understand its native
divinity, its earthly frailty, its malleability, its contractions, its expansions
and its original propensities. In addition to all this knowledge,
when we judge the conduct of an individual, we must know the
predominants and exponents of his mind, the impress it has received
from education, the motives that impelled it to action, the circumstances
that produced its momentum, its propulsive and repulsive powers,
the ultimatum of its designs and its ulterior objects. With all
these guides we shall still become involved in errors unless our judgments
are based upon the firm foundation of impartiality and are enlightened
and warmed by the genial rays of heaven-born charity. Bias
and prejudice are ever at our elbows, ready to lead us to false conclusions.</p>

<p>With such criteria before me, I proceed to sketch, concisely, the
eventful career of <span class="smcap">Samuel Chase</span>, a native of Somerset county, Maryland,
who was born on the 17th of April, 1741. He was the son of
the Rev. Thomas Chase, who immigrated to this country from England,
and in 1743 became the pastor of St. Paul’s parish in Baltimore,
then a mere country village and destitute of good schools. At the
age of two years Samuel was deprived of the tender care of his mother
by her premature death. In the superior classical and theological
qualifications of his father to guide him in the paths of science and
virtue, he was peculiarly fortunate. Under his instructions he became
an accomplished scholar, admired and esteemed by a large circle
of acquaintances. At the age of eighteen he commenced the study of
law, and prosecuted it with great industry under the direction of John
Hammond and John Hall of Annapolis. At the age of twenty he was
admitted to practice in the mayor’s court, and at twenty-two was admitted
to several of the county courts and the court of chancery. He
located at Annapolis, married the amiable and intelligent Miss Ann
Baldwin, and soon obtained the reputation of a sound lawyer and an
able advocate.</p>

<p>He was of a sanguine temperament, bold, fearless and undisguised,
independent in mind, language and action, but honest, patriotic and
pure in his motives and immovable in his purposes—qualities that dignify
a man if prudently balanced, but which often rouse the most implacable
enmity in others. These leading traits in the original composition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
of the nature of Samuel Chase must be kept constantly in
view to enable the reader to form a just estimate of his character. The
circumstances and times that influenced him must also be borne in
mind.</p>

<p>On the flood tide of a prosperous business and forensic fame, in the
full enjoyment of domestic felicity and social intercourse with friends,
Mr. Chase glided smoothly along until his country began to writhe
under kingly oppression. The stamp act, the first born of the pernicious
revenue system devised by the putrescent British ministry, met
with a hostile reception in Annapolis. Mr. Chase, aided by a band of
kindred spirits under the cognomen of the “sons of liberty,” forcibly
seized and destroyed the newly imported stamps and burnt in effigy
the stamp distributor. No further violence was then committed. The
king’s officers opened a newspaper battery against this “furious mob,”
and directed their whole artillery at Mr. Chase, complimenting him
with the courtly names of “busy, restless incendiary; a ringleader of
mobs, a foul-mouthed and inflaming son of discord and faction; a common
disturber of the public tranquillity, a promoter of the lawless
excesses of the multitude,” and similar emphatic appellations—conferring
upon this young patriot a diploma of honour little anticipated
by them. His answers to these vituperations were charged with strong
and conclusive logic, keen and withering sarcasm. This brought him
into the political field, and so delighted were the people with the manner
he handled the hirelings of the crown that they elected him to the
colonial assembly. There he took a conspicuous part and became the
uncompromising opposer of all measures that were not within the pale
of the constitution or that were tinctured with oppression. So strongly
was he in favour of liberal principles and rational liberty, that he gave
his whole influence and vote in favour of the repeal of the law that compelled
the people to support the clergy, by which the stipend of his father
was reduced one half. Agreeably to the laws of primogeniture then in
force, this was voting money out of his own pocket in order to impart
greater freedom to the people at large. By his bold and independent
course he became an object for the persecution of the creatures of the
crown and an object of pride and admiration with the people. But
his enemies found him a bramble full of the keenest thorns and were
unmercifully scarified every time they approached him. His tongue,
his pen, his logic and his sarcasm were as blighting as the sirocco of
Sahara.</p>

<p>After the repeal of the stamp act a calm of the public mind ensued,
but it was a calm of delusion such as precedes a tornado. The inquisitorial
rack of the ministry was again put in motion; fresh impositions
commenced and the fire of discontent was again kindled. The
bill closing the port of Boston and authorizing the king’s officers to
seize and send to England for trial those who should dare resist the
royal authority, roused the indignation of the colonies that had before
been rather passive. A general Congress was agreed upon to meet
at Philadelphia, and Mr. Chase, with four others, was appointed a
member from Maryland. They were instructed to join in “agreeing
on a general plan of conduct operating on the commercial connexion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
of the colonies with the mother country for the relief of Boston and
preservation of American liberty.” A committee of correspondence
was also appointed, of which Mr. Chase was an active and efficient
member.</p>

<p>The deep solemnity and unparalleled wisdom and prudence that
marked the proceedings of the Congress of 1774, shed a lustre around
the cause of equal rights, then in embryo, that forced applause from
its most violent opposers. Had not the cabinet of Great Britain been
blinded by sordid avarice, mad ambition and political delusion, and
had not the king been a mere automaton, the moving, loyal and logical
appeals from that august body of sages would have been treated with
respect and peace restored. The colonists asked for nothing but what
was clearly right, and asked in the most respectful and even suppliant
manner. Ministers were left without an excuse; <em>their</em> sacrilegious
hands broke the great seal of the social compact; their agents sowed
the seeds of rebellion; their cruelty kindled the flame that devoured
them; their visionary policy severed the cords of maternal affection;
their treachery spread the mantle of righteousness over the cause of the
revolution. We justly censure them for their corrupt designs but rejoice
in the result of their projects. Haman erected his own gallows—Grenville
and North destroyed their own power.</p>

<p>In 1775, Mr. Chase was again returned to Congress, but was tramelled
with instructions of conciliation that were not congenial to his
ardent feelings. His prudence, however, kept him within their limits.
He was placed upon numerous committees and upon the very important
one of providing ways and means for preparing a naval armament.
The ensuing year he was again elected to the national legislature,
bound by instructions disavowing a desire for independence,
imposing upon him a course of amity and pacific submission that would
have induced him to decline serving, had he not hoped and predicted
truly that British violence would eventually remove the injunction.
In the spring of 1776 he was appointed upon an important mission,
in conjunction with Benjamin Franklin, Charles Carroll and Bishop
Carroll. These gentlemen proceeded to Canada for the purpose of
persuading the Canadians to join in shaking off the yoke of bondage.
The fall of General Montgomery and the dark gloom that hung over
the cause of liberty induced them to decline, and after the most faithful
and zealous efforts the committee were compelled to return without
accomplishing the desired object, and the Canadas are still enjoying
the cold comforts of foreign power. When he arrived and took
his seat in Congress he was rejoiced to learn that the subject of a final
separation from the mother country was under consideration and was
ably and boldly advocated. It was the very measure to animate the
soul of Samuel Chase. His instructions now became oppressive and
hung over him like an incubus. He redoubled his exertions to open
the eyes of the members of the Maryland convention and induce them
to leave him and his colleagues to act upon their own judgments. The
request was granted just in time for him to record his vote in favour
of that imperishable instrument that has immortalized the names of
its signers and is the pride of every true American. The same day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
that the declaration was adopted he was elected a third time to the
Continental Congress, and continued to serve in that body the two next
ensuing years.</p>

<p>A short time previous to the glorious fourth of July, Mr. Chase discovered
that a Judas was among them in the person of the Rev. Dr.
Zubly of Georgia, who was clandestinely corresponding with the enemy.
So suddenly did this ardent patriot proclaim the name of the
traitor upon the floor of Congress, that “the gentleman from Georgia”
admitted the truth of the charge and immediately retired from the
house. His arrest was ordered, but when the officers went to his cage
the bird had flown and was never “bagged.” No member but the
accuser and the accused knew the fact before it fell upon their ears
from Mr. Chase, like a thunder clap without a cloud in view. No one
served upon more committees during his time in Congress, and no
one performed his duty more cheerfully and faithfully than Mr. Chase.
In every branch of legislation he was found fully competent to act
well his part. In forming the articles of confederation he was all life
and industry; he considered their adoption indispensably necessary
to insure the completion of the good work already begun. The manner
of representation, the mode of voting and the claims to the south
sea, were the three points that elicited the most discussion. They were
finally concluded and carried the colonies safely through their long
and bloody struggle.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1776 Messrs. Chase, Wilson, Clymer, Stockton and
Smith, were appointed a committee to take charge of the war department,
the duties of which involved the great business of the nation.
This power was subsequently delegated to Washington, which relieved
these gentlemen from a most onerous burden. They cheerfully commenced
their labours and as cheerfully resigned their task to him, in
whose discretion and ability they had full confidence.</p>

<p>About this time Mr. Chase gave another example of his bold and
fearless disposition. It was ascertained that many of the members of
the society of Friends, in and about Philadelphia and New Jersey,
inimical to the American cause, were circulating papers calculated
to impede its progress, were acting in concert with the tories, and
were in communication with the enemy; a report of which, with documents
substantiating the charges, was submitted to Congress by the
committee for suppressing internal enemies, of which he was the prominent
member.</p>

<p>The exposure resulted in the confinement of several leading Quakers,
a suppression of the seditious papers, and a course of more
respectful neutrality by the society. The measure was then deemed
harsh by some, and, at first view, will appear more so now; but on
examination, taking into consideration all the circumstances of war,
it will be found to be in accordance with the rules of epic law.
Agreeably to the martial code of other nations, then the precedent
guide for Congress, the punishment might have been much more
severe. By the religious tenets of the society of Friends it can never
be sanctioned, and by every friend of liberty, the necessity of such a
case, imposed by the rules of war, is always regretted. Every social<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
compact and nation must be subject to its own laws, and minor parts
of a community must submit to the ruling majority or superior power, or
government cannot be maintained in any form. In 1777, Mr. Chase
proposed a resolution to make loan office certificates a legal tender
from whigs to tories for the payment of debts due. In 1778, the
British parliament attempted a stratagem by which they hoped to
create a division among the patriots by disseminating conciliatory
propositions among the people, and by appointing commissioners,
who, when they arrived, proposed conditions of inglorious peace.
These promissory and flattering papers were widely circulated, and
to counteract their influence it was necessary that Congress should
prepare an answer. This task was imposed upon a committee and
by that committee upon Mr. Chase. Most ably did he perform his
duty. He unmasked the hypocrisy of the ministers, exposed their
delusive gull trap to derision and scorn, and left them without a loop
to hang upon. So well was it received by Congress that an unusually
large number was ordered to be printed, and a resolution passed recommending
the clergy throughout the country to read it to their congregations
after service on Sundays. Like all the other plans of the
British cabinet then devised for enslaving the colonies, it recoiled
upon their own heads with all the force of re-action. The following
is a copy of the answer written by Mr. Chase.</p>

<p>“Three years have now passed away since the commencement of
the present war. A war without parallel in the annals of mankind.
It hath displayed a spectacle the most solemn that can possibly be
exhibited. On one side, we behold fraud and violence labouring in
the service of despotism; on the other, virtue and fortitude supporting
and establishing the rights of human nature.</p>

<p>“You cannot but remember how reluctantly we were dragged into
this arduous contest, and how repeatedly, with the earnestness of
humble entreaty, we supplicated a redress of our grievances from
him who ought to have been the father of his people. In vain did we
implore his protection; in vain appeal to the justice, the generosity of
Englishmen; of men who had been the guardians, the asserters and
vindicators of liberty through a succession of ages; men, who, with
their swords had established the firm barrier of freedom, and cemented
it with the blood of heroes. Every effort was vain; for even whilst
we were prostrated at the foot of the throne, that fatal blow was struck
which hath separated us forever. Thus spurned, contemned and insulted;
thus driven by our enemies into measures which our souls
abhorred, we made a solemn appeal to the tribunal of unerring wisdom
and justice. To that Almighty ruler of princes whose kingdom
is over all.</p>

<p>“We were then quite defenceless. Without arms, without ammunition,
without clothing, without ships, without money, without officers
skilled in war; with no other reliance but the bravery of our
people and the justice of our cause. We had to contend with a nation
great in arts and in arms, whose fleets covered the ocean, whose banners
had waved in triumph through every quarter of the globe. However<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
unequal this contest, our weakness was still farther increased
by the enemies which America had nourished in her bosom. Thus
exposed on the one hand to external force and internal divisions; on
the other to be compelled to drink of the bitter cup of slavery and to
go sorrowing all our lives long—in this sad alternative we chose the
former. To this alternative we were reduced by men, who, had they
been animated by one spark of generosity, would have disdained to
take such mean advantage of our situation, or had they paid the least
regard to the rules of justice would have considered with abhorrence
a proposition to injure those who had faithfully fought their battles,
and industriously contributed to rear the edifice of their glory.</p>

<p>“But however great the injustice of our foes in commencing this
war, it is by no means equal to that cruelty with which they have conducted
it. The course of their armies is marked by rapine and devastation.
Thousands, without distinction of age or sex, have been
driven from their peaceful abodes to encounter the rigours of inclement
seasons, and the face of heaven hath been insulted by the wanton
conflagration of defenceless towns. Their victories have been followed
by the cool murder of men no longer able to resist, and those
who escaped from the first act of carnage have been exposed by cold,
hunger and nakedness—to wear out a miserable existence in the tedious
hours of confinement, or to become the destroyers of their countrymen,
of their friends, perhaps, dreadful idea! of their parents or
children. Nor was this the outrageous barbarity of an individual, but
a system of deliberate malice, stamped with the concurrence of the
British legislature, and sanctioned with all the formalities of law.
Nay, determined to dissolve the closest bonds of society, they have
stimulated servants to slay their masters in the peaceful hour of domestic
security. And, as if all this were insufficient to slake their
thirst of blood, the blood of brothers, of unoffending brothers, they
have excited the Indians against us; and a general, who calls himself
a christian, a follower of the merciful Jesus, hath dared to proclaim
to all the world his intention of letting loose against us whole hosts
of savages, whose rule of warfare is promiscuous carnage—who rejoice
to murder the infant smiling in its mother’s arms—to inflict on
their prisoners the most excruciating torments, and exhibit scenes of
horror from which nature recoils.</p>

<p>“Were it possible, they would have added to this terrible system:
for they have offered the inhabitants of these states to be exported by
their merchants to the sickly, baneful climes of India, there to perish:
an offer not accepted, merely from the impracticability of carrying it
into execution.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding these great provocations we have treated such of
them as fell into our hands with tenderness, and studiously endeavoured
to alleviate the afflictions of their captivity. This conduct we
have pursued so far as to be by them stigmatized with cowardice, and
by our friends with folly. But our dependence was not upon man.
It was upon Him who hath commanded us to love our enemies and
to render good for evil. And what can be more wonderful than the
manner of our deliverance? How often have we been reduced to distress,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
and yet been raised up? When the means to prosecute the war
have been wanting to us, have not our foes themselves been rendered
instrumental in providing them? This hath been done in such a variety
of instances so peculiarly marked almost by the direct interposition
of Providence, that not to feel and acknowledge his protection,
would be the height of impious ingratitude.</p>

<p>“At length that God of battles, in whom was our trust, hath conducted
us through the paths of danger and distress to the thresholds
of security. It hath now become morally certain, that if we have
courage to persevere we shall establish our liberties and independence.
The haughty prince who spurned us from his feet with contumely and
disdain; and the parliament which proscribed us, now descend to offer
terms of accommodation. Whilst in the full career of victory, they
pulled off the mask and avowed their intended despotism. But having
lavished in vain the blood and treasure of their subjects in pursuit
of this execrable purpose, they now endeavour to ensnare us with
the insidious offers of peace. They would seduce you into a dependence
which, necessarily, inevitably leads to the most humiliating
slavery. And do they believe that you will accept these fatal terms?
Because you have suffered the distresses of war, do they suppose that
you will basely lick the dust before the feet of your destroyers? Can
there be an American so lost to the feelings which adorn human nature—to
the generous pride, the elevation, the dignity of freedom? Is
there a man who would not abhor a dependence upon those who have
deluged his country in the blood of its inhabitants? We cannot suppose
this, neither is it possible that they themselves can expect to
make many converts. What then is their intention? Is it not to lull
you with the fallacious hopes of peace, until they can assemble new
armies to prosecute their nefarious designs? If this is not the case,
why do they strain every nerve to levy men throughout their islands?
Why do they meanly court every little tyrant of Europe to sell them
his unhappy slaves? Why do they continue to embitter the minds of
the savages against you? Surely this is not the way to conciliate the
affections of America. Be not therefore deceived. You have still to
expect one severe conflict. Your foreign alliances, though they secure
your independence, cannot secure your country from desolation,
your habitations from plunder, your wives from insult or violation,
nor your children from butchery. Foiled in their principal design,
you must expect to feel the rage of disappointed ambition. Arise
then! to your tents! and gird you for battle. It is time to turn the
headlong current of vengeance upon the heads of the destroyers. They
have filled up the measure of their abominations, and like ripe fruit
must soon drop from the tree. Although much is done, yet much remains
to do. Expect not peace whilst any corner of America is in
possession of your foes. You must drive them away from the land of
promise, a land flowing indeed with milk and honey. Your brethren
at the extremities of the continent already implore your friendship and
protection. It is your duty to grant their request. They hunger and
thirst after liberty. Be it yours to dispense the heavenly gift. And
what is there now to prevent it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
“After the unremitted efforts of our enemies we are stronger than
before. Nor can the wicked emissaries who so assiduously labour to
promote their cause, point out any one reason to suppose that we shall
not receive daily accessions of strength. They tell you, it is true,
that your money is of no value; and your debts so enormous that they
can never be paid. But we tell you that if Britain persecutes the war
another campaign, that single campaign will cost her more than we
have hitherto expended; and yet these men would prevail upon you
to take up that immense load, and for it to sacrifice your dearest
rights; for surely there is no man so absurd as to suppose that the
least shadow of liberty can be preserved in a dependant connexion
with Great Britain. From the nature of the thing it is evident that
the only security you could obtain, would be the justice and moderation
of a parliament who have sold the rights of their own constituents.
And this slender security is still farther weakened by the consideration
that it was pledged to rebels, (as they unjustly call the good
people of these states,) with whom they think they are not bound to
keep faith by any law whatsoever. Thus would you be cast bound
among men whose minds, by your virtuous resistance, have been
sharpened to the keenest edge of revenge. Thus would your children
and your children’s children, be by you forced to a participation
of all their debts, their wars, their luxuries and their crimes; and this
mad and this impious system they would lead you to adopt because
of the derangement of your finances.</p>

<p>“It becomes you deeply to reflect on this subject. Is there a country
upon earth which hath such resources for the payment of her debts as
America? Such an extensive territory; so fertile, so blessed in its
climate and productions. Surely there is none. Neither is there
any to which the wise Europeans will sooner confide their property.
What then are the reasons that your money hath depreciated? Because
no taxes have been imposed to carry on the war; because your
commerce hath been interrupted by your enemies’ fleets; because
their armies have ravaged and desolated a part of your country; because
their agents have villanously counterfeited your bills; because
extortioners among you, inflamed with the lust of gain, have added to
the price of every article of life; and because weak men have been
artfully led to believe that it is of no value. How is this dangerous
disease to be remedied? Let those among you who have leisure and
opportunity collect the monies which individuals in their neighbourhood
are desirous of placing in the public funds. Let the several
legislatures sink their respective emissions, that so there being but
one kind of bills there may be less danger of counterfeits. Refrain a
little from purchasing those things which are not absolutely necessary,
that so those who have engrossed commodities may suffer, (as they
deservedly will,) the loss of their ill gotten hoards, by reason of the
commerce with foreign nations, which the fleets will protect. Above
all, bring forward your armies into the field. Trust not to appearances
of peace or safety. Be assured that unless you persevere you
will be exposed to every species of barbarity. But if you exert the
means of defence which God and nature have given you, the time will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
soon arrive when every man shall sit under his own vine and fig-tree,
and there shall be none to make him afraid.</p>

<p>“The sweets of a free commerce with every part of the earth will
soon reimburse you for all the losses you have sustained. The full
tide of wealth will flow in upon your shores, free from the arbitrary
impositions of those whose interest and whose declared policy it was
to check your growth. Your interests will be fostered and nourished
by governments that derive their power from your grant, and will be
obliged, by the influence of cogent necessity, to exert it in your
favour.</p>

<p>“It is to obtain these things that we call for your strenuous, unremitted
exertions. Yet do not believe that you have been or can be
saved merely by your own strength. No! it is by the assistance of
heaven; and this you must assiduously cultivate by acts which heaven
approves. Thus shall the power and the happiness of these sovereign,
free and independent states, founded on the virtue of their citizens,
increase, extend and endure, until the Almighty shall blot out all the
empires of the earth.”</p>

<p>This brilliant display of talent closed the congressional labours of
this devoted friend of liberty. He retired with all the honours of a
statesman, a sage, a patriot and an honest man. He had stood firmly
at his post a faithful public servant, a bold advocate for freedom and
the rights of man, an acute and discerning counsellor in every emergency,
a fearless champion in times of danger, an ornament to his
country and a terror to his enemies. As a working man he had no
superior, as a debater he had but few equals. Without the mellifluous
elocution of a Cicero, or any pleonastic parade, he spoke forcibly,
reasoned closely, demonstrated clearly and deduced conclusively.
He sought to inform the judgment, enlighten the understanding and
to convince by sound argument. After the close of the revolution,
Mr. Chase was sent to England to prosecute a claim in favour of Maryland
for bank stock, and obtained for the state six hundred and
fifty thousand dollars. His journal during his absence shows that he
was a close observer of men and things in the minutest particulars.
His high attainments as a lawyer, a scholar and a statesman—his frank
and gentlemanly deportment and his thorough and persevering business
habits, made a very favourable impression upon the British barristers
and members of parliament. He remained in Europe nearly
a year, and on his return resumed the practice of law.</p>

<p>In 1786, he removed to Baltimore, in consequence of which his
worthy friend, Colonel Howard, at whose solicitation he changed his
residence, conveyed to him in fee a square of ten lots of ground
situated near the plot designed for the public buildings, on the condition
that he located upon it. This square is bounded by Eutaw, Lexington,
Fayette and Paca streets, and the mansion house built by Mr.
Chase is still owned by his descendants.</p>

<p>In 1788, he was appointed chief justice of the new criminal court
organized for the then town and county of Baltimore, and the same
year was a member of the Maryland convention that ratified the federal
constitution. In 1791, he was appointed chief justice of the general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
court of his native state; and in 1796, he was appointed, by President
Washington, an associate judge of the supreme court of the
United States, which dignified station he filled with great ability to
the time of his demise. He was esteemed one of the ablest judges
upon the bench, and when serving in the courts below, seldom had
one of his decisions reversed. His expositions of law and his charges to
juries were learned, luminous, logical and profound. His manner was
forcible, impressive and commanding. With all this lustre around
him, and with his great and acknowledged services in the cause of
the revolution still green and fresh, Judge Chase was placed in the
crucible of severe and unrelenting persecution, prompted alone by
political animosity, created by the lofty independence of thought and
expression before alluded to, and which prepared him to act a bold,
conspicuous and useful part, when the fury of British wrath was poured
out upon his country.</p>

<p>In January, 1804, John Randolph obtained the passage of a resolution
in the house of representatives of the United States, instituting
an inquiry into the official conduct of Judge Chase, and as a salvo the
name of Judge Peters was added. No man was ever more vigorous
and persevering in the accomplishment of an object than Mr. Randolph,
and no one was more capable of consummating his designs.
The committee reported on the sixth of the ensuing March, acquitting
Judge Peters from all blame, and recommending the impeachment of
Judge Chase. On the 26th of the same month six articles of impeachment
were reported, predicated upon the following grounds: In 1800,
he presided with Judge Peters at Philadelphia, when and where John
Fries, who had been tried before Judges Peters and Iredel at the previous
session for treason against the government of Pennsylvania, was
put upon his trial a second time, in consequence of some informality
at his first. Having been fully informed of the points of law at issue
and the proceedings of the first trial, Judge Chase previously prepared
an elaborate exposition of his opinions upon the law of treason, and
with his constitutional frankness, and with the approbation of Judge
Peters, submitted a copy to the counsel for the defendant and to the
district attorney, reserving a copy for the jury <em>after</em> the trial was over.
Messrs. Lewis and Dallas, counsel for the prisoner, considered this
<em>professionally</em> and <em>professedly</em> a pre-judgment of the case, suffered
Fries to be tried without any aid, undoubtedly intending and successfully
succeeding in creating an excitement of sympathy that procured
his pardon immediately after conviction. Fries subsequently called
upon Judge Chase and thanked him for the impartial manner he had
treated him when on his trial. The whole matter was then considered,
as it undoubtedly was, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ruse de guerre</i> of ingenious counsel, and no
one attributed any bad motives to the bench. The approval of Judge
Peters at the time is a conclusive evidence that the course of Judge
Chase was not only pure in design, but that it was not in violation of
the strictest rules of judiciary proceedings. He had given an opinion
upon the <em>law</em>, not upon the <em>facts</em> of the case. This he was bound
to explain to the grand jurors before they proceeded to find any
bills, and to the traverse jury that tried each prisoner. This constituted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
the first charge in the impeachment. Shortly after, a man
named Callendar was tried before Judge Chase in Richmond, Virginia,
under the sedition law, for publishing a libel upon the president.
During the trial the judge refused the admission of testimony offered
on the part of the prisoner, as he believed illegally, and thereby
greatly offended those who were opposed to the law in question. He
believed the law salutary, as he did that which suppressed the tories
and Quakers in 1776; and believed the venality of the press required
a check; many others thought differently. The law, right or wrong,
he was compelled by his oath of office to execute so long as it remained
in force. That his <em>legal</em> decisions were correct, must be presumed, or
a writ of error would have been taken under the existing excitement.
This formed the foundation of the second charge.</p>

<p>From Virginia he proceeded to New Castle, Delaware, where he
held a court aided by Judge Bedford. In his charge to the grand
jurors, presuming that cases under the unpopular sedition law might
come before them, he gave his views frankly upon it, and that they
might better understand what constituted a breach of its provisions,
alluded to the publications of a high toned party paper printed in the
district, as containing the kind of libels intended to be suppressed by
it. This gave great offence to those who were opposed to it. But
the judge only discharged a duty which he had sworn to perform.
The personal allusion may be considered by some uncourteous, but
his object was plain and simple demonstration for which he was always
remarkable. No ingenuity has or ever can fairly construe it
into a pre-judgment of the case. The publications were before him,
they came clearly within the meaning and intention of the law. He
charged them upon no individual specifically, but that some one had
published them was beyond dispute, and that they were in violation
of the law in question, was to his mind equally plain. This constituted
the ground of the third article of the impeachment.</p>

<p>In 1803, Judge Chase, in delivering his charge to the grand jury of
Baltimore, having become a decided federalist and believing the course
pursued by the democrats was wrong, made sundry remarks upon the
politics of the day. This was, in my opinion, a surplusage of duty,
but not a subject of impeachment, and may be traced to the warm
temperament of his mind, the great political excitement of that period,
and to the innovations, as he believed them, upon the constitution
and laws by political influence, without discovering a shadow of impurity
in his motives. Freedom of speech is a constitutional privilege,
and he was only using the same liberty claimed by his opponents,
and which was then given by the repeal of the sedition law. That
it was a proper time and place to read a political lecture I do not pretend,
but it does not therefore follow that his designs were corrupt
or his conduct criminal. The ermine of a judge is not rendered more
comely by being powdered with the farina of politics, but his right to
think and speak upon this subject, none will question. He animadverted
in his charge upon the alterations of the constitution of his native
state, particularly upon that of the extension of the right of suffrage,
to which he had strong objections. In this particular his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
opinions were in unison with many of the most devoted patriots of the
revolution, who deemed the elective franchise unsafe if controlled by
uninformed men, who, not distinctly understanding, would not properly
appreciate their rights. The reasons for this opinion were stronger
then than now, and an anxiety to preserve the government pure and
undefiled, unquestionably pervaded the bosom of Judge Chase.</p>

<p>In another part of this charge to the grand jury he spoke strongly
against the changes that had been made in the judiciary system of the
United States, attributed them to party politics, and deemed them
personal in their objects and not conducive to the public good in their
operation. The last two points were proper subjects of comment, inasmuch
as they related to his official duties. That a man like him
should remark severely upon what he believed to be impolitic or
wrong, was a matter of course. He was never accustomed to half-way
business. In all this nothing appears to lead any candid mind
to suppose he was not honest in his intentions and pure in his motives.
Upon these premises the six articles of impeachment were based, and
at the next session, out of the same material, two more were manufactured—the
natural increase of a year.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of January, 1805, Judge Chase was arraigned before the
Senate of the United States, a majority of the members being politically
opposed to him, but among them were men who loved justice more than
party. The gigantic powers of Mr. Randolph were brought to bear
against the accused with all their force. The trial continued, except a
short recess, until the first of March, a part of which time the Judge
was confined by illness. He was defended by Messrs. Martin, Hopkinson,
Harper and Key, ably and faithfully. Of five of the charges he
was acquitted by a majority of the Senate, and a constitutional number
could not be obtained to convict him on the others, and of course he
stood approved, acquitted and triumphant over his enemies at the
highest tribunal of his country. He had never doubted the favourable
result and was at no time depressed by the prosecution. From that
period to the time of his last illness his peace was undisturbed, and he
continued to be an ornament to the judiciary, an honour to his country,
and the faithful friend of human rights and equal justice. On
the 19th of June, 1811, surrounded by his family and friends and
in the full enjoyment of the smiles of his Redeemer, he bade a last
farewell to sublunary things and died peaceful and happy.</p>

<p>In the character of this great and good man we find no corruption
to condemn, and many strong and brilliant traits to admire. As a
revolutionary patriot he stood on a lofty eminence; as a statesman he
rendered many and important services; as a lawyer he enjoyed a high
reputation; as a judge, his talents and legal acquirements were of the
most exalted character. All the charges against his judicial career,
and the result of their investigation, have been faithfully laid before
the reader, who is left to examine impartially, and I hope, to judge
correctly. I find no evidence of guile in his heart; he expressed his
opinions freely, he felt them strongly, and was evidently sincere in
his conclusions.</p>

<p>Against his private character malice and slander never directed an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
arrow. He was in all respects above suspicion. He was a kind husband,
an affectionate father, a warm friend, and an open, honourable,
but scarifying enemy. From the constitution of his nature and the
vehemence of his feelings, he was calculated to gain strong friends
and create violent enemies. His independence and decision were
admired, but often roused animosity in others. His political opponents
he handled with great severity, which accounts for the mighty
effort made to prostrate him.</p>

<p>He was a man of a noble and benevolent disposition—a friend to
the poor and needy. A particular instance of his generosity was
exhibited in 1783. Listening to the discussions of a debating club
in Baltimore, he was forcibly struck with the talent exhibited by a
youth, to him an utter stranger. On inquiry, he found that he was
poor, and in the employment of an apothecary. He called upon him,
advised him to study law; offered him a home at his house, the use
of his library, and the aid of his instruction. His proposition was
accepted; the youth arrived at manhood, rose to eminence, and became
an ornament to America. This was the celebrated William Pinkney,
who was minister to Russia, London, Naples, and attorney-general
of the United States. He often recurred to his benefactor with feelings
of the profoundest gratitude in after life.</p>

<p>Judge Chase was also a friend to education and religion. He was
a member of St. Paul parish, and was active in promoting the best
interests of practical piety, social order and purity of morals. His
force, vigour, and decision of character and stern integrity, were admirably
calculated for the period in which he lived; and if he sometimes
offended by soaring above the non-committal system of technical
politics, it must be attributed to the strong combination of conflicting
circumstances that uniformly attend the period of a revolution, the
formation of a new government, and the asperity of high-toned parties,
operating as they did upon the sensitive feelings of an ardent, patriotic
and independent mind.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_53">WILLIAM HOOPER.</h2>
</div>

<p>The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. This ancient apothegm
can never be controverted by the ingenuity of sophistry; it is
based upon reason, justice, and sound philosophy. Its solution is brief.
To be wise is to be good—to be good is to be happy. To avoid all
vice and practise only virtue, is the great desideratum of earthly bliss.
Virtue carries with it its own reward. Vanity and vain glory may
be richly laden with blossoms, but they bear no fruit. We must
look to the great Author of all good for substantial enjoyment; we must
fear to offend the majesty of his laws to be truly wise. The greatest
men who have ever figured upon the stage of action, fully recognised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
the power of omnipotence, and feared to offend the great Jehovah.
The sages of the American revolution were constantly under the influence
of this salutary principle. This may be inferred from their
writings, their examples, and the proceedings of the Continental Congress.
Days of humiliation and prayer were frequently fixed and
recommended by legislative proclamation, by the states and by the
general government.</p>

<p>Among those of the signers who appears to have lived with the fear
of God before his eyes, was <span class="smcap">William Hooper</span>, a native of Boston,
Massachusetts, born on the 17th of June, 1742. He was the son of
the Reverend William Hooper, who came from Kelso, in the south of
Scotland, and was for many years the pastor of Trinity church in
Boston. He was a man of high accomplishments, a good scholar, an
able and eloquent preacher, and a devoted christian. He was useful
in life and lived in the affections of his people.</p>

<p>William, being of a slender constitution, received the first rudiments
of his education from his father under the parental roof. At the age
of seven years he was placed under the care of Mr. Lovell, and at the
age of fifteen he entered Harvard University. His talents were of a high
order and his industry untiring. His mind was moulded in wisdom,
and averse to trifling amusements and fleeting pleasures. During vacation
he repaired to his father’s library and devoted himself to the
acquisition of knowledge, instead of obtaining a relaxation from study
by mingling in the convivial circle. He had a great taste for the
classics and polite literature. He paid particular attention to composition
and elocution. Refinement in every thing was his aim.</p>

<p>In 1760, he graduated with the degree of bachelor of arts, and commenced
the study of law under James Otis, one of the most distinguished
counsellors of that day. From the pious course of his life
from his youth up, his father had indulged a hope that his inclination
would have led him to the pulpit, but cheerfully submitted to the
choice he had made. The same industry and correct deportment that
carried him successfully through college, enabled him to master the
intricate science of his election, and gain the esteem of all who knew
him. After completing his course he was admitted to practice, richly
stored with theory for future use.</p>

<p>Manhood had now spread its dignified mantle over him. He was
of the middle height, slender and elegant in form, gentlemanly and
engaging in his manners, with strangers rather reserve, with his friends
frank and familiar, free from affectation, of a serious turn, and at all
times honest and sincere. His countenance beamed with intelligence
and benignity, his powers of conversation were pleasing and instructive,
chaste and classical. His mind was investigating, deliberative,
analyzing and firm. His habits were strictly moral; his disposition
was benevolent, hospitable and kind. As a public speaker he was
eloquent, persuasive, logical and sometimes sarcastic. With qualities
like these, Mr. Hooper repaired to Wilmington, North Carolina, in
1766, and commenced the practice of his profession. He was induced
to locate there by several wealthy connexions residing in that place.
He soon obtained a lucrative business; and to convince the people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
that he contemplated a permanent location among them, he married
Miss Anna Clark, a lady of unusual accomplishments and strength
of mind, and highly respectable in her character and connexions.
She was the sister of General Thomas Clark.</p>

<p>His legal fame rose rapidly and was built upon a substantial basis.
About the year 1768, he was employed to conduct several important
public trials, which he managed with such skill and address, as to
place him among the ablest advocates of the province. He was treated
with marked attention by Governors Tryon and Martin, and by chief
justice Howard.</p>

<p>These attentions from the king’s officers arose, in a measure, from
the superior talents and merit of Mr. Hooper, but had also an ulterior
object—that of gaining his influence in favour of the designs of their
royal master. This could not be accomplished. He had received his
legal education in Boston, where the designs of ministers had been
probed for years. He had imbibed liberal principles and was a friend
to equal rights. Upon the firm basis of eternal justice he had planted
himself, from which flattery could not decoy him nor threatening
dangers drive him.</p>

<p>One peculiar circumstance may have caused a particular attachment
for him on the part of the officers of government, that of having
taken a bold stand against a class of desperadoes called <em>regulators</em>,
who formed a dangerous association as early as 1766, in the interior of
the province. They were composed principally of men who were
ignorant, poor and savage, collected and led by men of more intelligence
but of baser minds, who incited them to open rebellion by complaints
against the civil authorities, and the promise of reward. They
drove the judges from the bench and committed many personal outrages.
They even set the military at defiance, and threatened to
assume the entire rule. At that alarming crisis, Mr. Hooper was one
who came forward and dared to advise decisive measures. The number
of the regulators had accumulated to three thousand. The plan of Mr.
Hooper was carried into execution; a military force was raised, a
severe battle ensued and the insurgents were dispersed. This occurred
in 1770.</p>

<p>In 1773, Mr. Hooper was elected a member of the assembly of
North Carolina, and discharged his duties so much to the satisfaction of
his constituents, that they returned him the ensuing year. It was then
that the creatures of the crown attempted to throw a ministerial coil of
oppression around the people, and it was then that they found a bold,
fearless, eloquent and uncompromising opponent in William Hooper.
He not only met them in the legislative hall with incontrovertible
arguments, but he spread their designs before the public far and wide,
by a series of essays over the signature of Hampden. His course was
in favour of liberal principles, but ruinous to his purse. The question
before the assembly was the re-organization of the judiciary,
which had become defunct by the expiration of the statute that
created it. An attempt was made to model it in such a manner as
to meet the designs of the British cabinet. So powerful was the influence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
of Mr. Hooper, that he kept his opponents at bay, and the province
was a year without any courts.</p>

<p>He was now fairly before the people, a champion for liberty. On
the 25th of August, 1774, he was appointed a delegate to the Congress
of Philadelphia. In that body he was placed on the important
committee that prepared a statement of the rights of the colonies, the
manner these rights had been infringed, and the most probable means
of affecting their restoration. He was also one of the committee that
reported the statutes that affected the trade and manufactures of the
colonies. Upon the report of these two committees all the conclusive
proceedings of that Congress were based, from which we may infer
that the ablest and most active men were placed upon them. The
ensuing year he was re-elected to the national assembly, and soon
after he took his seat, he was appointed chairman of a committee to
prepare an address to the people of Jamaica relative to British oppression.
It was written by him, and is in a style bold, vigorous and
classical. The following extract is a fair sample. Speaking of the
plan of action laid and pursued by the British ministry, he writes:
“That our petitions have been treated with disdain, is now become
the smallest part of our complaint. Ministerial insolence is lost in
ministerial barbarity. It has, by an exertion peculiarly ingenious,
procured those very measures which it laid us under the hard necessity
of pursuing, to be stigmatised in parliament as rebellious. It has
plunged us in all the horrors and calamities of civil war. It has
caused the treasures and blood of Britain, formerly exhausted and
shed for far other ends, to be spilt and wasted in the execrable design
of spreading slavery over British America. It will not, however,
accomplished its aim; in the worst contingency a choice will still be
left which it can never prevent us from taking.”</p>

<p>On the 12th of June, Mr. Hooper offered the following resolution in
Congress, which demonstrates the position taken in the exordium of
this sketch.</p>

<p>“It is at all times an indispensable duty devoutly to acknowledge the
superintending providence of the great governor of the world, especially
in times of impending danger and public calamity—to reverence and
adore his immutable justice as well as to implore his merciful interposition
for our deliverance; therefore,</p>

<p>“Resolved, that it is recommended by Congress that the people of
the American colonies observe the twentieth day of July next as a
day of public humiliation, fasting and prayer.”</p>

<p>The zeal and exertions of this patriot were of the most vigorous
character. He served on numerous committees and was highly esteemed
by all the members. His constituents were so well satisfied
with his course that he was returned a third time to the honourable
post he had so ably filled. In the spring of 1776, he was a member of
the conventions that convened at Hillsborough and Halifax, and was
one of the leading and most eloquent speakers. He also prepared an
address to the people of the British empire that was written with much
nerve and energy. He then repaired to his place in Congress,
and boldly supported the declaration of rights. He had long been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
convinced of its propriety, and when the thrilling moment arrived for
the final decision he sanctioned it by his vote and signature. He was
an unwavering friend to the cause he had espoused; patient, cheerful,
persevering, prudent and firm under all circumstances.</p>

<p>In February, 1777, he obtained leave of absence from Congress and
returned to his family. When the news of the defeat of Washington
at Germantown reached him at Wilmington, he was surrounded by a
circle of his friends, who seemed dismayed at the intelligence. He
rose calmly from his seat and remarked, with great animation and
cheerfulness, “We have been disappointed!—but no matter—now
that we have become the assailants there can be no doubt of the
issue.”</p>

<p>Before his return his property had suffered from royal vengeance;
his personal safety now became endangered and he was compelled to
fly into the interior for safety. His family had removed several times.
He made arrangements, in the event of the subjugation of the colonies
by the British, to remove to one of the French West India Islands,
where, it is said, all the signers, with the French minister, would have
went, had not the independence of the states been sustained. He
did not return to Wilmington until it was evacuated in 1781, during
which time his family was there, exposed to the insults of the enemy.
He appears not to have returned to Congress again, but mingled with
the people, rousing them to a sense of their duty, and was an active
member of the state councils. In 1782 he removed to Hillsborough,
and endeavoured to restore his long neglected private affairs to order.
In 1786, he was appointed by Congress a judge of the court organized
to settle the controversy between New York and Massachusetts relative
to disputed territory, a delicate and important duty, from which
he was relieved by an amicable settlement by the litigants before the
court proceeded to act in the premises.</p>

<p>Mr. Hooper continued to take a conspicuous part in the legislation
of North Carolina, and also pursued the practice of his profession until
1787, when his health began to decline and he retired from public life
and from the bar, to enjoy that repose in domestic felicity which had
always been more congenial to his mind than public stations, however
lofty. In his retirement he carried with him the esteem of his fellow
citizens and the gratitude of a nation of freemen. Not a blemish
could be found to tarnish the fair fame of his public career or private
reputation. He had served his country faithfully and discharged the
duties of friend, citizen, lawyer, patriot, husband and father, with
fidelity. From the elevated eminence of conscious integrity he looked
back upon his past life—with the eyes of faith he looked forward to a
crown of unfading glory, and in October 1790, closed his eyes in
death and resigned his soul to that God whom to fear is the beginning
of wisdom.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_54">THOMAS NELSON.</h2>
</div>

<p>Honesty is a virtue that commands universal respect. This term,
like many others, has lost much of its original force and is too promiscuously
used. When Pope proclaimed an honest man the noblest
work of God, he included purpose, word and action in all things, under
all circumstances and at all times. He alluded to a man whose purity
of heart placed him above every temptation to violate the original laws
of integrity which emanated from the High Chancery of Heaven. His
imagination pictured a man whose every action through his whole life
should pass the moral scrutiny of omniscience unscathed, and stand
approved at the dread tribunal of the great Jehovah. Such a man is
a noble work indeed, worthy of the highest admiration and closest imitation.</p>

<p>The signers of the declaration of independence were remarkable
for integrity, and none of them more so than <span class="smcap">Thomas Nelson</span>, who
was born at York, Virginia, on the 26th of December, 1738. He was
the son of William Nelson, whose father was a native of England and
settled in York at an early period. The father of Thomas was an
enterprising and successful merchant, and eventually became also a
wealthy planter. He filled many public stations with great ability,
and during the interval between the administration of Lord Bottetourt
and Lord Dunmore, presided over the colony <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex officio</i>, being then
president of the executive council.</p>

<p>At the age of fourteen years Thomas Nelson was placed under the
instruction of Mr. Newcomb, whose school was near Hackney, England.
When his preparatory studies were completed he was placed
at Cambridge and entered of Trinity College, under the tuition of Dr.
Beilby Porteus, who was one of the brightest literary ornaments of his
age and ultimately became the bishop of London. Guided by the
master-hand of this finished scholar, accomplished gentleman and
pious man, Mr. Nelson traced the fair lines of science and explored
the avenues of literature. The principles of virtue and integrity were
also deeply impressed upon his mind and governed his actions through
life. After spending eight years at the classic fountain in England,
he returned to Virginia, highly polished in mind and person. He entered
into the enjoyment of a large landed estate, and over one hundred
and thirty thousand dollars in cash. In August, 1762, he led to the
hymeneal altar Miss Lucy, daughter of Philip Grymes, of Brandon,
and settled permanently at his native place. His house became the
seat of hospitality and domestic felicity. He assimilated his style of
life, in some respects, to that of an English nobleman when at his
country seat. He rode almost daily to his plantation, a few miles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
from York, and amused himself with his gun. He also kept a pack
of hounds and in the winter often joined in the thrilling and blood-stirring
sport of the fox-chase. No respectable stranger could visit
the town without receiving an urgent invitation to partake of his hospitality.
In this manner his time passed smoothly along until the public
demanded his services.</p>

<p>For a long time a particular intimacy existed between the leading
men of Virginia and those of England. This arose from consanguinity
and wealth and was kept alive for a century by an interchange of good
feelings and offices. The sons of the wealthy men of the Old Dominion
were uniformly educated in Great Britain, and imbibed the same
feelings of independence manifested by the noblemen of the mother
country, and felt themselves, very properly, entitled to as much confidence
from the king as a native and resident of Albion. Hence,
when the car of oppression was mounted by the British ministry, the
noblest sons of Virginia were the most vigorous opposers of royal
power. They at once acted in concert with the patriots of New England
and treated the insults offered at Boston as though they had been
personally directed to them. The very fact of former intimacy made
this opposition more bitter and pointed.</p>

<p>In 1774, Mr. Nelson was elected to the house of burgesses and took
a bold stand in favour of liberal principles. He was one of the eighty-nine
members who assembled at a tavern the day after Lord Dunmore
dissolved the house and formed themselves into an association of non-intercourse
with Great Britain. At the next election he was again
returned to the house of burgesses. He was a member of the convention,
held on the first of August of that year, to elect delegates to Congress,
and of the one convened in March, 1775, for this and other purposes.
He supported the boldest measures that were proposed by the
daring Patrick Henry, from which many of the patriots at first recoiled
with amazement. He had no ear for the syren song of peace when
the shores of his country were darkened by foreign fleets and armies.
From the following resolutions introduced in the last named convention
by Patrick Henry, the reader can form an idea of the feelings
that pervaded the minds of the leading patriots at that early period.
One of the germs of our militia system will also be perceived.</p>

<p>“Resolved, that a well regulated militia, composed of gentlemen and
yeomen, is the natural strength and only security of a free government;
that such a militia in this colony would for ever render it unnecessary
for the mother country to keep among us, for the purpose
of our defence, any standing army of mercenary soldiers, always subversive
of the quiet and dangerous to the liberties of the people, and
would obviate the pretext of taxing for their support.</p>

<p>“That the establishment of such a militia is, at this time, peculiarly
necessary by the state of our laws, some of which have already expired
and others will shortly be so—and that the known remissness of government
in calling us together in legislative capacity renders it too
insecure, in this time of danger and distress, to rely that opportunity
will be given of renewing them in general assembly, or making any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
provision to secure our inestimable rights and liberties from those
further violations with which they are threatened.</p>

<p>“Resolved, therefore, that this colony be immediately put in a state
of defence, and that —— be a committee to prepare a plan for embodying,
arming and disciplining such a number of men as may be
sufficient for that purpose.”</p>

<p>These resolutions were warmly supported by Mr. Nelson, whose
property was exposed to the utmost danger in case of an open rupture
with the royal authorities. The measure proposed was carried into
effect, and from that time opposition to the pretensions of the crown
assumed a bold front in Virginia. This convention assembled again
in July, and divided the colony into sixteen military districts, the
eastern district to raise forthwith a regiment of six hundred and eighty
men, rank and file, and each of the others to raise a battalion of five
hundred, to be at once armed and held in readiness to march at any
moment. The convention also directed the raising of two regiments
of regulars of one thousand and twenty privates, and appointed
Patrick Henry to command the first and Mr. Nelson to command
the second. Thus Virginia assumed a determined and systematic
attitude of defence at an early period.</p>

<p>On the 11th of August this convention met again and elected Mr.
Nelson a delegate to the Continental Congress, in which he took his
seat on the 13th of September following. Possessed of a strong mind
and sound judgment, he became a useful member of committees, but
seldom took part in debate. By the following letter from him to
Governor Page, it seems he was one of those who agitated the question
of independence as early as the 22nd of January, 1776. “I
wish I knew the sentiments of our people upon the grand points of
confederation and foreign alliance, or, in other words, of independence—for
we cannot expect to form a connexion with any foreign
power as long as we have a womanish hankering after Great Britain—and,
to be sure, there is not in nature a greater absurdity than to suppose
we can have any affection for a people who are carrying on the
most savage war against us.” On the 13th of February, he writes to
the same gentleman again, as follows: “Independence, confederation
and foreign alliance are as formidable to some members of Congress,
I fear a majority, as an apparition to a weak enervated woman.
Would you think we have some among us who still expect honourable
proposals from the administration! By heavens—I am an infidel in
politics, for I do not believe were you to bid a thousand pounds per
scruple for honour at the court of Great Britain, that you would get
as many as would amount to an ounce. We are now carrying on a
war and no war. They seize our property wherever they find it,
either by land or sea, and we hesitate to retaliate because we have a
few friends in England who have ships. Away with such squeamishness,
say I.”</p>

<p>By this language we can judge of the ardent feelings that actuated
this friend of equal rights. It was the pure fire of patriotism, fanned
by a just indignation against a tyrannical and insolent foe. It was a
fire that reflected a powerful heat upon those around it, and gathered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
fresh vigour daily. Like separate parcels of metal in a crucible, one
member after another yielded to its power, until all were united in
one liquid mass, and, on the fourth of July, 1776, the mould of liberty
was filled, which, when opened to the gaze of the world, presented a
new and purely original table of law and government, enriched by
the embossment of freedom and equal rights. On this fair tablet,
more beautiful than mosaic-work, Mr. Nelson engraved his name in
bold relievo. Here we might leave him, with glory enough for one
man. But he had then just entered the portico of his useful career.
He embarked heart and soul in the cause, and became one of the
most industrious members of various committees that was in Congress.
In forming the articles of confederation he was particularly active.
The ensuing year he again took his seat in the national assembly, but
was compelled to retire in May, soon after the commencement of the
session, in consequence of a severe attack of disease in his head,
which, for a time, threatened to impair his mental powers. He was
obliged to return home, and for a short period refrain from business.
His place was supplied by Mr. Mason.</p>

<p>In August following, the appearance of a British fleet that entered
the capes caused a general rally of the military force of Virginia.
Mr. Nelson, who had regained his health, was commissioned by the
governor and council brigadier-general and commander-in-chief of
the military forces of the state. The appointment was popular—the
incumbent was competent. His appearance among them inspired
confidence in the people. The troops rallied around him like affectionate
children around a fond parent. The fleet, however, did not
deign to give them a call at that time, and the soldiers again became
citizens.</p>

<p>In October, General Nelson took his seat in the legislature of his
state, and acted a conspicuous part in its deliberations. During the
session a bill was brought before the house sequestrating British property,
and authorizing those of the colonists who were indebted to
subjects of Great Britain to pay the amount into the public treasury;
and if the wives and children of such subjects remained in the state,
portions of the said money, under the direction of the governor and
council, were to be appropriated to their support. With all the
ardour and vehemence of feeling that pervaded the bosom of Mr.
Nelson against the mother country, his honesty and justice impelled
him to oppose this bill as violating the sacredness of individual contracts.
He became roused, and made an able and eloquent address
against the proposed measure, and closed in the following emphatic
language:—“For these reasons I hope the bill will be rejected; but
whatever be its fate, so help me God, I will pay <em>my</em> debts like an
honest man.”</p>

<p>On the second of March, 1778, Congress made an appeal to the
patriotism of the wealthy young men of the several colonies, urging
them to raise a troop of light cavalry at their own expense. Nor was
the appeal in vain. As soon as the proposed plan of Congress was
received in Virginia, General Nelson sent a circular to all the young
gentlemen of fortune in the state, recommending them not only to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
come to the rescue themselves, but to open their purses to other high
minded and respectable young men, whose hearts were noble but
whose means were limited. A company of seventy was speedily
raised in Virginia, and elected general Nelson their commander.
He proceeded with his new charge to Baltimore and reported his
youthful band to the brave Pulaski, who received this accession of
volunteers with delight and admiration. From that place the company
proceeded to Philadelphia, where the general and his men
received the praise and thanks of Congress; and as their services were
not wanted at that time, they were permitted to return to their homes.
The expenses of the company during their absence were principally
borne by General Nelson without any subsequent remuneration; and
for his own services in the field during the war he refused to receive
any pay; and, in addition to this, he expended a great portion of his
fortune in the cause of his country.</p>

<p>On the 18th of February, 1779, General Nelson again took his seat
in Congress, and was immediately placed on several important committees.
His severe labour caused a second attack similar to the
former, and in April he was compelled to return home.</p>

<p>It was in May of that year that the British made a descent upon
Virginia, and spread destruction far and wide. Exercise soon restored
the health of General Nelson and he at once took the field.
He assembled a body of troops near Yorktown, but the enemy chose
not to interfere with him at that time. During that short campaign
he took a parental care of the soldiers by providing for their wants
from his own funds. He distributed his labourers and servants among
the poor families of the militia from his neighbourhood to labour during
the absence of the men. He was as benevolent as he was patriotic
and brave.</p>

<p>In June, 1780, the general assembly of Virginia passed a resolution
to borrow two millions of dollars for the purpose of defraying the
expenses of the war. General Nelson entered into the collection of
this money with great zeal. Public credit was prostrated and government
paper was no longer considered security. Like Robert Morris,
he at once pledged his own fortune and raised large sums upon his
own credit, for which he was but in part remunerated by government.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1781, Virginia was again the scene of murder,
rapine, and wide spread ruin. Judas, alias Arnold, and Lord Cornwallis
were sweeping over the land like a tornado. General Nelson
was constantly in the field, doing all in his power to arrest the bold
and savage career of the invading foe. He became the hero of the
Old Dominion. In June he was elected governor of the state. He
immediately entered upon the discharge of this dignified station, and
bent his whole energies in raising troops to resist the enemy.</p>

<p>About that time Lafayette arrived with a body of regulars. Governor
Nelson joined him in the field, and, yielding his rank, placed
himself and the militia under the command of the marquis. Every
thing within his power he grasped to aid his bleeding country. He
placed even his draught horses and negroes in the public service.</p>

<p>In the midst of these distresses a circumstance occurred that was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
exceedingly trying to his mind. By the constitution, the governor
acted only in concert with the council. Two of that body had fallen
into the hands of Tarleton, and two had resigned. It was impossible
to raise a quorum for business. The awful crisis demanded immediate
and decisive action. In this dilemma he transcended the existing
law, and proceeded to act as though the council was with him.</p>

<p>At a subsequent period this was made the foundation of a complaint
against him, after he retired to private life and was sinking under
disease, which was forever put at rest by the legislature, by the passage
of laws sanctioning his every public act during that campaign.
Ingratitude is the prime minister of hell, and revenge its secretary.</p>

<p>At length Lord Cornwallis found himself snugly ensconced in
Yorktown. A dark cloud gathered over his military fame. Awful
forebodings haunted his blood-stained soul. Retributive justice pierced
his conscience with a thousand stings. The cries of widows and
orphans, the curling flames of hospitable mansions, the sweeping
destruction of villages and towns, and the dying groans of innocent
victims, the bitter fruits of his tyranny, preyed upon his imagination
like a promethean vulture. The die was cast. The siege was commenced.
At the head of the Virginia troops was General Nelson—cool,
brave, fearless and vigorous. His native town, his own domicile
and property, were now to be razed. At first he observed that the
American batteries carefully avoided the direction of his house. The
principal British officers, anticipating this, had made it their rendezvous.
On hearing that it was out of respect to him, he directed the
gunners to point their guns at once at his mansion. The first discharge
sent a shot through it and killed two of the officers, a number
of whom were enjoying the comforts of a good dinner. They soon
left this retreat for safer quarters.</p>

<p>The following extract from the general orders of the illustrious
Washington, of the 20th of October, 1781, will best inform the reader
how highly the services of Governor Nelson were prized at that
memorable siege that crushed the power of Great Britain in America.</p>

<p>“The general would be guilty of the highest ingratitude, a crime
of which he hopes he shall never be accused, if he forgot to return his
sincere acknowledgements to his excellency Governor Nelson for the
succours which he received from him and the militia under his command,
to whose activity, emulation and bravery, the highest praises
are due. The magnitude of the acquisition will be ample compensation
for the difficulties and dangers which they met with so much
firmness and patriotism.”</p>

<p>The fatigues of this campaign and his arduous gubernatorial duties
proved too much for the physical powers of Governor Nelson. He
again sunk under disease, and on the 20th of November, 1781, he resigned
his station and retired to private life. He spent the remainder
of his days principally on a small estate he had saved from the wreck
of his large fortune, situated at Offly, in the county of Hanover. His
health continued to decline, and on the fourth of January, 1789, he
was numbered with the dead.</p>

<p>His obituary, written by his bosom friend, Colonel Innes, fully portrays<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
the character of this devoted patriot and deserves a place in this
memoir.</p>

<p>The illustrious general <span class="smcap">Thomas Nelson</span>, is no more! He paid the
last debt to nature on Sunday, the fourth of the present month, at his
estate in Hanover. He who undertakes barely to recite the exalted
virtues which adorned the life of this great and good man, will unavoidably
pronounce a panegyric upon human nature. As a man, a
citizen, a legislator and a patriot, he exhibited a conduct untarnished
and undebased by sordid or selfish interests, and strongly marked
with the genuine characteristics of true religion, sound benevolence
and liberal policy. Entertaining the most ardent love for civil and religious
liberty, he was among the first of that glorious band of patriots
whose exertions dashed and defeated the machinations of British
tyranny and gave to United America freedom and independent empire.
At a most important crisis during the late struggle for American
liberty, when this state appeared to be designated as the theatre of action
for the contending armies, he was selected by the unanimous suffrage
of the legislature to command the virtuous yeomanry of his country.
In this honourable employment he remained until the end of the war.
As a soldier, he was indefatigably active and coolly intrepid. Resolute
and undejected in misfortunes, he towered above distress and
struggled with the manifold difficulties to which his situation exposed
him with constancy and courage. In the memorable year of 1781,
when the whole force of the southern British army was directed to the
immediate subjugation of this state, he was called to the helm of government.
This was a juncture which indeed “tried men’s souls.”
He did not avail himself of this opportunity to retire in the rear of
danger, but, on the contrary, took the field at the head of his countrymen,
and, at the hazard of his life, his fame and individual fortune,
by his decision and magnanimity, he saved not only his country, but
all America from disgrace, if not from total ruin. Of this truly patriotic
and heroic conduct, the renowned commander-in-chief, with all
the gallant officers of the combined armies employed at the siege of
York, will bear ample testimony. This part of his conduct even contemporary
jealousy, envy and malignity were forced to approve—and
this, more impartial posterity, if it can believe, will almost adore. If,
after contemplating the splendid and heroic parts of his character, we
shall inquire for the milder virtues of humanity and seek for the man,
we shall find the refined, beneficent and social qualities of private life,
through all its forms and combinations, so happily modified and united
in him, that in the words of the darling poet of nature, it may be said,</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_55">JAMES SMITH.</h2>
</div>

<p>Many men, like apes, are mere imitative beings in their manner of
action. They forsake the path designed for them by their Creator,
and strive to assimilate their mechanical movements to some noble
personage of a higher order by nature than themselves, and thus <em>ape</em>
their way through the world. I refer particularly to public speakers.
Some young men of respectable native talent and good acquirements,
when they mount the rostrum, instead of acting perfectly natural, endeavour
to imitate some orator of notoriety, and thereby render themselves
ridiculous. Originality is the beauty of forensic or any other
kind of eloquence. Like a piece of marble under the hands of the
statuary, a more systematic form may be imparted by art, but its original
composition, like that, is most beautiful unpainted. Originality
must form the base, or the superstructure can never be truly beautiful.
No human ingenuity can remould the work of nature and retain the
strength of the grand original. We should imitate the virtues and
wisdom of great and good men—our <em>manner</em> should be peculiarly our
own—and still further—our language and style of writing should be
original to render it forcible and interesting. Affectation in any thing
is disgusting to sensible men, and a discerning man readily detects a
counterfeit.</p>

<p>A fine picture of originality and pleasing eccentricity was exhibited
by <span class="smcap">James Smith</span>, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.
He was a native of Ireland and came to this country with
his father when quite young. The precise time of his birth is not
known. According to the only record known of his age—the inscription
on his tomb, he was born in 1713. His father was a respectable
farmer and settled on the west side of the Susquehanna river nearly
opposite to Columbia. James was educated under Dr. Allison. He
acquired a good classical education, and retained a peculiar taste for
authors of antiquity through life. He was very partial to mathematics,
and became an expert surveyor. After finishing his course
under Dr. Allison he commenced the study of law in Lancaster,
Pennsylvania, some say with Thomas Cookson, but more probably
with his elder brother who was then practising at that town. When
admitted to the bar he located himself on the frontiers of civilization
near the present site of Shippensburg, in Cumberland county, blending
the practice of law and surveying. In that section of the country
the two professions were then very properly and profitably united.
Large tracts of valuable land were held under hasty and inaccurate
surveys, and many others were only located by mere chamber calculations
upon paper. Litigation was the natural consequence, and no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
witnesses told the truth more accurately than the compass of Mr.
Smith and the demonstration of his protractor. Possessed of a penetrating
mind, he looked into future prospects and secured much valuable
land and had full employment in his professional business. He
soon found himself on the flood tide of prosperity. Not willing to
sail alone, he took for his mate, Miss Eleanor Armor, of Newcastle,
who superintended his cabin stores with great skill and prudence.
In every thing he was purely original. With a strong mind, an open
and honest heart, a benevolent and manly disposition, he united
great conviviality and amusing drollery, yet so discreet as not to
offend the most modest ear. He delighted in seeing the contortions
of the risible muscles, which were uniformly in motion in all proper
circles when James Smith was present. Whenever he came in contact
with a pedant he would propound some ridiculous question with
the utmost gravity, such as the following, “Don’t you remember that
terrible bloody battle which Alexander the Great fought with the
Russians near the straits of Babelmandel? I think you will find the
account in Thucydides or Herodotus.”</p>

<p>His memory was retentive and stored with numerous anecdotes,
which he used in court either to annoy his opponent and help his
case, or in company to amuse his friends. No one could tell a story
with more effect than Mr. Smith. His manner was original and beyond
imitation. With all his wit and humour, he held religion in
the greatest reverence, and was a communicant of the church. No
one that knew him dare utter a word against it in his presence, knowing
that the lash of the keenest ridicule would at once be applied by
him. Such a mixture of qualities are rarely blended in one man.
From the deep toned logic and the profoundest thought up to the eccentric
ridiculous, all balanced by the happy equilibrium of discretion,
his mind ranged with the rapidity of lightning, using each at the
most appropriate time and place. His manner, his style, and his
every thing, from the most trivial circumstance to the momentous
concerns of the nation in which he participated, were purely original.</p>

<p>Of the affairs of his country Mr. Smith was not an idle spectator. No
man delights in liberty and independence more than an Irishman, and
no nation is more sensitive of its rights than “sweet Ireland.” When
British oppression showed its hydra head to the colonists, although
advanced in age, James Smith took a terrible dislike to the beast and
was for making fight unless it withdrew its visible deformity forthwith.
His heart beat high for his adopted country, and he at once
came boldly forward in its defence. At that time he was a resident
of York and extensively engaged in iron works as well as in professional
business, having become a very distinguished lawyer. He had
never consented to fill public stations, and nothing but the purest patriotism
and the importance of the threatened crisis, could have induced
him to enter the public arena. In the language of Josiah Quincy,
he had become convinced that—“We must be grossly ignorant of the
importance and value of the prize for which we contend—we must be
equally ignorant of the power of those who have combined against us—we
must be blind to that malice, inveteracy and insatiable revenge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
which actuate our enemies, public and private, abroad and in our
bosoms, to hope that we shall end this controversy without the sharpest—sharpest
conflicts; to flatter ourselves that popular resolves, popular
harangues, popular acclamations and popular vapour will vanquish
our foes. Let us consider the issue—let us look to the end.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was a man that looked at both the beginning and the
end. He was a man who examined closely causes, effects, and results.
He also understood human nature and knew well the disposition
of the colonists. He was convinced the bone and sinew of the
land would never yield to the tyranny of mother Britain without a
“sharp conflict.” For that conflict he was prepared.</p>

<p>The first step taken in Pennsylvania relative to the existing oppressions,
was the assembling of a convention of delegates from each
county, in order to ascertain the feelings of the people generally relative
to the course proposed by the patriots of New England, where
the revolutionary storm had already commenced its precursory droppings.
Of this convention Mr. Smith was a delegate, and was one of
the committee that prepared the instructions to the members of the
next general assembly of the province, recommending, among other
things, the appointment of delegates to the general Congress to be
convened at Philadelphia, with instructions from which the following
is an extract, sufficient to inform the reader of the grievances most
particularly complained of at that early period.</p>

<p>“We desire of you therefore—that the deputies you appoint may
be instructed by you strenuously to exert themselves at the ensuing
Congress to obtain a renunciation on the part of Great Britain of all the
powers under the statute of the 35th of Henry the Eighth, ch. 2nd—of
all powers of internal legislation—of imposing taxes or duties internal
or external and of regulating trade, except with respect to any new
articles of commerce which the colonies may hereafter raise, as silk,
wine, &amp;c., reserving a right to carry them from one colony to another—a
repeal of all statutes for quartering troops in the colonies or subjecting
them to any expense on account of such troops—of all statutes
imposing duties to be paid in the colonies, that were passed at the
accession of his present majesty, or before this time, which ever period
shall be judged most advisable—of the statutes giving the courts of
admiralty in the colonies greater power than the courts of admiralty
have in England—of the statutes of the 5th of George the Second,
ch. 22nd, and of the 23d of George the Second, ch. 29th—of the
statute for shutting up the port of Boston—and of every other statute
particularly affecting the province of Massachusetts bay, passed in the
last session of parliament. If all the terms above mentioned cannot
be obtained, it is our opinion that the measures adopted by the Congress
for our relief, should never be relinquished or intermitted, until
those relating to the troops—internal legislation—imposition of taxes
or duties hereafter—the 35th of Henry the Eighth, ch. 2nd,—the extension
of admiralty courts—the port of Boston and the province of
Massachusetts bay are obtained. Every modification, or qualification
of these points, in our judgment should be inadmissible.”</p>

<p>By the statute of the 35th of Henry the Eighth, ch. 2nd, a citizen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
of America was liable to be arrested and carried to England to be
tried, when accused of high crimes. By the 5th of George the Second,
ch. 23d, the colonists were prohibited from exporting hats, and hatters
were even limited as to the number of apprentices they should keep
to learn this trade; in order, as the statute declares, “that hatting
may be better encouraged in Great Britain.” The other acts referred
to infringements of sundry local arrangements of the colonies equally
obnoxious with the above; and when the final list of grievances was
completed at a subsequent time, many statutes under George the
Third were complained of as violating the constitution of England
and the charters predicated upon it, which had grown sacred by long
and acknowledged usage, by learned and legal construction, and by
numerous declaratory acts of the British parliament, passed when sitting
under the mantle of reason, equity, justice and sound policy.</p>

<p>By these instructions, directly from the people, we can judge of
the feeling that pervaded the great mass of the yeomanry at that time;
and by referring to the instructions given to the delegates appointed
by the assembly of the province to Congress, it will be seen that royal
influence still pervaded that body, as they contain scarcely a definite
feature or point similar to those from the primary convention of the
people.<a id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">E</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_E" href="#FNanchor_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> See them at large in the biography of George Ross.</p></div>

<p>So fully convinced was Mr. Smith of the issue between the colonies
and mother Britain, that on his return home he immediately raised a
company of volunteers, and was elected its captain by acclamation.
This was the pioneer company of Pennsylvania, raised for the purpose
of resisting tyranny. This company was organized about nine months
before the bloody affair at Lexington; showing deep penetration and
sagacious foresight in its original. He introduced thorough discipline
in the corps, and imparted to its members the same holy fire of
patriotism that was illuminating his own soul. Around this military
nucleus accumulating force continued to increase, until it formed a
regiment. Mr. Smith accepted the honorary title of its colonel, but
imposed the actual commanding duties upon a younger man. He
had given a momentum to the ball, and was gratified to see it rolling
onward towards the temple of liberty with an increased impetus.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was a member of the next convention that convened in
January, 1775, at Philadelphia. He was among the foremost to oppose
force to force, and peril life for freedom. He was then called an
<em>ultra</em> whig, and considered as treating the government of his majesty
with disrespect. His patriotism had carried him six months in advance
of most of the leading men, and no one could outstrip him in
zeal for the cause of equal rights. His course was onward—right
onward to action. For this the time soon arrived. During the year
1775 he took a conspicuous part in public measures, and in the spring
of the ensuing year was appointed upon a committee, with Dr. Rush
and Colonel Bayard, to organize a camp of four thousand five hundred
troops, to be raised in Pennsylvania. No man was better calculated
to render efficient aid in this important business. The committee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
immediately prepared, and, under the sanction of Congress, published
an address to the volunteer and yeomen military of Pennsylvania,
urging them to rally under the standard of liberty. In order that the
reader may have a sample of every kind of proceeding and address
that characterized the revolution that gave to us freedom, I insert an
extract from this.</p>

<p>“We need not remind you that you are now furnished with new
motives to animate and support your courage. You are not about to
contend against the power of Great Britain in order to displace one
set of villains to make room for another. Your arms will not be
enervated in the day of battle with the reflection that you are to risk
your lives or shed your blood for a British tyrant, or that your posterity
will have your work to do over again. You are about to contend
for permanent freedom, to be supported by a government which will
be derived from yourselves, and which will have for its object, not
the emolument of one man or class of men only, but the safety, liberty
and happiness of every individual in the community. We call upon
you, therefore, by the respect and obedience which are due to the
authority of the <span class="smcap smaller">UNITED COLONIES</span>, to concur in this important measure.
The present campaign will probably decide the fate of America. It
is now in your power to immortalize your names by mingling your
achievements with the events of the year 1776—a year which, we
hope, will be famed in the annals of history to the end of time, for
establishing, on a lasting foundation, the liberties of one quarter of
the globe. Remember the honour of our colony is at stake. Should
you desert the common cause at the present juncture, the glory you
have acquired by your former exertions of strength and virtue will
be tarnished; and our friends and brethren, who are now acquiring
laurels in the most remote parts of America, will reproach us, and
blush to own themselves natives or inhabitants of Pennsylvania. But
there are other motives before you. Your houses, your fields, the
legacies of your ancestors, or the dear bought fruits of your own
industry and your liberty, now urge you to the field. These cannot
plead with you in vain, or we might point out to you further—your
wives, your children, your aged fathers and mothers, who now look
up to you for aid, and hope for salvation in this day of calamity only
from the instrumentality of your swords.”</p>

<p>This appeal had a most powerful and salutary effect, and met with
a response from the people that drove the royal power from Pennsylvania
like chaff before the wind. Simultaneous with the preparation
of the declaration of independence in Congress, delegates were elected
to raise the arch of a republican constitution and government over
the keystone state. The members of the convention for this purpose
convened on the 15th of July, and in the declaration of rights just
promulged from Congress Hall, had a polar star to guide them—a
master piece for a pattern to direct them.</p>

<p>In this convention Mr. Smith took his seat, and was immediately
placed upon the committee appointed to prepare a declaration of rights.
His <em>ultraism</em> had become an admired quality, and assumed the baptismal
name of <em>patriotism</em>. His worth and zeal were now duly appreciated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
and he became one of the most influential men in his state.
On the 20th of July he was called to higher duties than those of the
convention, by his appointment to the Continental Congress. This
was as unexpected to him as it was pleasing to his friends. He
immediately enrolled his name with the apostles of liberty upon the
chart of freemen. Anxious to see the foundations of the new government
firmly laid in Pennsylvania, he continued his services in the
convention until the constitution assumed a visible form. He was
one of the committee that remodelled the penal code. He was as
humane in his feelings as he was ardent in the cause of his country.
Justice and mercy were blended in his heart.</p>

<p>Early in October he assumed fully his congressional duties. The
first part of the instructions to the delegation of the keystone state
is worthy of particular notice; and if general obedience could be enforced,
would be quite apropos at the present day. It is as follows:</p>

<p>“The immense and irreparable injury which a free country may
sustain by, and the great inconveniences which always arise from a
delay of its councils, induce us, in the first place, strictly to enjoin
and require you to give not only a <em>constant</em>, but a <em>punctual</em> attendance
in Congress.”</p>

<p>At the commencement of our free government, the will of the
people was respected and obeyed. Their public servants were not
then their political masters. Committee rooms were not then diverted
from their proper use by partisan caucuses. The halls of legislation
were not then the forum of personal recrimination and unparliamentary
procedure. The mantle of infantile purity was then spread over
those in high stations. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pro bono publico</i> was the order of the day—<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro
libertate patriæ</i> was the motto of each freeman.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith obeyed his instructions to the letter. He entered heart
and soul into the labours of the house and committee room. A dark
gloom was at that time spread over the cause of liberty, and many of
its warmest friends considered success a paradox. At such a time
the sprightliness and drollery of Mr. Smith was a powerful antidote
against despondency. Always cheerful and elastic, always seasoning
his conversation and speeches in the forum with original wit and
humour, he imparted convivial life to those around him. Amidst the
waves of misfortune and the breakers of disappointment, he floated like
a buoy on the ocean, above them all. The following letter written to
his wife, when General Howe was bending his triumphant course
towards Philadelphia, from which place Congress was soon after compelled
to retreat before him, shows that no hyppish feelings pervaded
his imagination.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“If Mr. Wilson should come through York, give him a flogging—he
should have been here a week ago. I expect, however, to come home
before election—my three months are nearly up. General left this on
Thursday—I wrote to you by Colonel Kennedy.</p>

<p>“This morning I put on the red jacket under my shirt. Yesterday
I dined at Mr. Morris’s, and got wet going home and my shoulder got
troublesome—but by running a hot smoothing iron over it three times,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
it got better. This is a new and cheap cure. My respects to all
friends and neighbours-my love to the children.</p>

<p class="sigright"><span class="l4">I am your loving husband, whilst</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">James Smith</span>.<br /></p>

<p class="p0">“<i>Congress Chamber, 11 o’clock.</i>”</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1">On the 23d of November, he was on the committee with Messrs.
Clymer, Chase, and Stockton, appointed to devise means for reinforcing
the American army, and for arresting the victorious and destructive
career of General Howe. The powers of this committee were
soon after very properly transferred to Washington. Mr. Smith was
also on the committee that laid before Congress the testimony of
the inhuman treatment of the British towards the American prisoners
at New York.</p>

<p>Having suffered severe losses by being absent from his private business,
he declined a re-election to Congress for the ensuing year, but
was made to understand by his constituents that he was public property
and must be used. He was continued at his post and abated
none of his zeal. So devoted was he in the service of his country,
that when Congress was compelled to fly to York, his place of residence,
he closed his office against his clients and gave it up to the
board of war. He sacrificed every private consideration that he believed
would promote the public good.</p>

<p>In November, 1778, he resigned his seat in Congress, and once
more enjoyed for a season the comforts of retirement. He deemed
his advanced age an ample excuse, after he was convinced that the
independence of his country was rendered doubly sure by the French
alliance.</p>

<p>In 1780, Mr. Smith was induced to take a seat in the legislature of
his state. He entered upon his duties with the same activity that
had characterized his whole public career. After completing his
term of service he retired finally from political life. He continued to
pursue his professional business with great success and profit, until
1800, having been an active member of the bar for sixty years. His
eccentricity, wit and humour, retained their originality to the last
years of his existence. He was a great admirer of the illustrious
Washington. A castigation from his ironical tongue, was the sure
consequence to any one, at any time or place, who spoke against
religion or Washington, two points upon which he was extremely
sensitive. The former he adored, the latter he revered. He corresponded
regularly with Franklin, Samuel Adams, and several others
of the patriarch patriots, and had preserved a valuable cabinet of
letters from those apostles of liberty, which was destroyed by fire, with
his office and its contents, about a year before his death. Surrounded
by an affectionate family and a large circle of ardent and admiring
friends, this happy son of Erin glided smoothly down the stream of life
until the eleventh day of July, 1806, when his frail bark was anchored
in the bay of death, and his immortal spirit was transferred to the
realms of glory.</p>

<p>In life he had lived usefully and esteemed; in his exit from earth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
he left a blank not readily filled. His public and private reputation
were untarnished and unsullied. He had contributed much towards the
freedom of his country; he was the life of every circle in which he
moved. Ennui could not live in his presence. He was warm hearted,
kind, and affectionate, and a friend to the poor. He never entertained
malice, but used his enemies very much as a playful kitten does a
mouse—teasing without a desire to hurt them—a propensity that
rendered him more formidable than a knight of the sword and pistols.
Such pure originals as <span class="smcap">James Smith</span> are like the inimitable paintings
of the ancient artists—few in market and difficult to be copied.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_56">JOSEPH HEWES.</h2>
</div>

<p>The cardinal virtue of charity, like the patriotism of ’76, is more
frequently professed than practised. It is placed at the head of all
the christian virtues by St. Paul, one of the ablest divines that ever
graced a pulpit or wielded a pen. Charity is a child of heaven—the
substratum of philanthropy, the brightest star in the christian’s diadem—the
connecting link between man and his Creator—the golden chain
that reaches from earth to mansions of bliss. It spurns from its presence
the scrofula of green-eyed jealousy—the canker of self-tormenting
envy— the tortures of heart-chilling malice, and the typhoid
of foaming revenge. It neutralizes and tames the fiercer passions of
man and prepares him for that brighter world where this darling
attribute reigns triumphant without a rival. Could its benign influence
reach the hearts of all mankind, the partition walls of sectarianism
would crumble and disappear—national and individual happiness
would increase, and many of the dark clouds of human woe and
misery would vanish before its heart-cheering and soul-enlivening rays,
like the morning fog before the rising sun. It is a true and impartial
mirror set in the frame of love and resting on equity and justice.</p>

<p>These preliminary remarks are elicited from a review of the life of
the subject of this biographette, whose father was among the persecuted
Quakers of New England, and was compelled to fly from Connecticut
to New Jersey in consequence of his religious tenets. It is
an inconsistency of human nature that when those who have suffered
by religious persecution from superior force obtain the reigns of power,
they often become the persecutors of all who will not succumb to their
authority and dogmatical notions. In the biography of Charles Carroll
the reader has recognised one example. Under the administration
of the “Cambridge Platform,” commenced by the ecclesiastical
convention of New England in 1646, and completed in 1648, a sterner
policy was pursued towards the Quakers than against the Roman
Catholics. On this “Platform” the municipal and legislative regulations
were based for about sixty years. In 1656, the legislature of
Massachusetts passed a law prohibiting every master of a vessel from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
bringing a Quaker into the colony under a penalty of one hundred
pounds. The next year a law was passed by the same body, inflicting
the most barbarous cruelties upon the members of this sect, such
as cutting off their ears, boring their tongues with a hot iron, &amp;c.,
unless they would desist from their mode of worship and doff their
straight coats and ugly bonnets. In 1669, a law was passed banishing
them on pain of death, and four of them who refused to go were
executed. Some historians have endeavoured to excuse this cruelty
on the ground that the Quakers provoked their persecutors by promulgating
their doctrines too boldly. This reason is too far-fetched,
and shrinks at once from the scrutiny of charity and justice. No
apology can be found until we can convert the baser passions of human
nature into virtues. By recurring to the ignorance, bigotry and
fanaticism of that period, we can readily discover <em>why</em> such a course
was pursued, but this affords no healing balm for the mind of a true
philanthropist. We can only regret the past and rejoice that charity
has so far triumphed as to restore men to a degree of reason that has
paralyzed persecution unto blood for opinion’s sake—one of the happy
traits of a free and liberal government.</p>

<p>To avoid the penalties of the “Platform” and the dangers of Indian
incursions, Aaron Hewes and Providence his wife, the parents
of the subject of this narrative, took up their residence near Kingston,
New Jersey, where they lived peacefully and died happily. When
they crossed the Housatonic river in their flight, they were so closely
pursued by the savages that Providence was severely wounded in the
neck by a bullet from one of their guns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Hewes</span>, their son, was born at the residence of his parents
near Kingston, in 1730. After receiving a good education in the
Princeton school, he commenced his commercial apprenticeship in the
city of Philadelphia. After completing this he entered into the mercantile
business and soon became an enterprising and successful merchant.
For several years he spent his time alternately at Philadelphia
and New York, and during that period was extensively engaged
in the shipping business.</p>

<p>He was a man of a lively disposition, penetrating mind and industrious
in all his undertakings. He was fond of social intercourse,
convivial parties, and sometimes joined in the dance. His figure was
elegant, his manners polished, his countenance intelligent and attractive,
and his whole course highly honourable and just.</p>

<p>At the age of thirty he located at Edenton, North Carolina, and
was soon after called to a seat in the assembly of that province. He
became a substantial and useful member, but made no pretensions to
oratory. He was a faithful working man, a correct voter, and was
uniformly in the assembly until elected to Congress.</p>

<p>When the revolutionary storm commenced, Mr. Hewes was among
those who pledged their lives, fortunes and honours to support the
cause of equal rights. He was a member of the Congress of 1774, and
was placed upon the important committee appointed to report the
rights of the American colonies, the manner they had been infringed
and the best means of obtaining their restoration. From this fact, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
from the report of the committee, we may infer that Mr. Hewes was
possessed of a clear head, a sound and deliberate judgment, and understood
well the principles of constitutional law and chartered privileges.</p>

<p>The report of this committee is a lucid and elaborate document.
By referring to the declaration of independence the reader will learn
the features of its first part—by referring to the instructions from the
primary convention of the delegates of Pennsylvania, in the biography
of James Smith, the nature of the second part will be seen. The preliminary
means of obtaining redress are fully set forth in the following
extract. After reciting the injuries of the mother country, the report
proceeds,</p>

<p>“Therefore we do, for ourselves and the inhabitants of the several
colonies whom we represent, firmly agree and associate under the
sacred ties of virtue, honour and love of our country, as follows:</p>

<p><i>First.</i> That from and after the first day of December next, we will
not import into British America, from Great Britain or Ireland, any
goods, wares or merchandise whatsoever, or from any other place any
such goods, wares or merchandise as shall have been exported from
Great Britain or Ireland; nor will we, after that day, import any East
India tea from any part of the world, nor any molasses, sirups, coffee,
or pimento from the British plantations or from Dominico, nor wine
from Madeira or the West Indies, nor foreign indigo.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> We will neither import nor purchase any slaves imported
after the first day of December next; after which time we will wholly
discontinue the slave trade, and will neither be concerned in it ourselves,
nor will we hire our vessels, nor sell our commodities or manufactures
to those who are concerned in it.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> As a non-consumption agreement, strictly adhered to, will
be an effectual security for the observation of the non-importation, we
as above solemnly agree and associate, that from this day we will not
purchase or use any tea imported on account of the East India Company,
or any on which a duty has been or shall be paid—and from the
first day of March next, we will not purchase or use any East India
tea whatever; nor will we, nor shall any person for or under us, purchase
or use any of these goods, wares or merchandise we have agreed
not to import, which we shall know, or have cause to suspect, were
imported after the first day of December, except such as come under
the rules and directions of the tenth article hereafter mentioned.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> The earnest desire we have not to injure our fellow subjects
in Great Britain, Ireland or the West Indies, induces us to suspend
a non-importation until the tenth day of September, 1775, at
which time, if the said acts and parts of acts of the British parliament
thereinafter mentioned<a id="FNanchor_F" href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">F</a> are not repealed, we will not, directly or indirectly,
export any merchandise or commodities whatsoever to Great
Britain, Ireland or the West Indies, except rice to Europe.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_F" href="#FNanchor_F" class="fnanchor">F</a> See biography of James Smith, p. <a href="#hdr_55">260</a>, for the acts referred to in substance.</p></div>

<p><i>Fifth.</i> Such as are merchants, and use the British and Irish trade,
will give orders as soon as possible to their factors, agents and correspondents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
in Great Britain and Ireland, not to ship any goods to
them on any pretence whatsoever, as they cannot be received in America;
and if any merchants residing in Great Britain or Ireland shall,
directly or indirectly, ship any goods, wares or merchandise for America,
in order to break the said non-importation agreement, or in any
manner contravene the same, on such unworthy conduct being well
tested, it ought to be made public; and on the same being so done, we
will not from henceforth have any commercial connexion with such
merchant.</p>

<p><i>Sixth.</i> That such as are owners of vessels will give positive orders
to their captains or masters, not to receive on board their vessels any
goods prohibited by the said non-importation agreement, on pain of
immediate dismission from their service.</p>

<p><i>Seventh.</i> We will use our utmost endeavours to improve the breed
of sheep and increase their number to the greatest extent, and to that
end we will kill them as seldom as may be, especially those of the
most profitable kind, nor will we export any to the West Indies or
elsewhere; and those of us who are, or may become overstocked with
or can conveniently spare any sheep, will dispose of them to our
neighbours, especially to the poorer sort, on moderate terms.</p>

<p><i>Eighth.</i> We will in our several stations encourage frugality, economy
and industry, and promote agriculture, arts and the manufactures
of this country, especially that of wool, and will discountenance and
discourage every species of extravagance and dissipation, especially
all horse racing and all kinds of gaming, cock fighting, exhibitions of
shows, plays, and other expensive diversions and entertainments, and
on the death of any relation or friend, none of us or any of our families
will go into any further mourning dress than a black crape or
ribbon on the arm or hat for gentlemen, and a black ribbon and necklace
for ladies, and we will discontinue the giving of gloves and scarfs
at funerals.</p>

<p><i>Ninth.</i> Such as are venders of goods and merchandise will not
take the advantage of the scarcity of goods that may be occasioned by
this association, but will sell the same at the rate we have been respectively
accustomed to do for twelve months last past: and if any
vender of goods or merchandise shall sell any such goods on higher
terms, or shall in any manner or by any device whatsoever depart from
this agreement, no person ought, nor will any of us deal with any such
person, or his or her factor or agent at any time hereafter, for any
commodity whatever.</p>

<p><i>Tenth.</i> In case any merchant, trader, or other persons shall import
any goods or merchandise after the first day of December, and before
the first day of February next, the same ought forthwith, at the election
of the owners, to be either re-shipped or delivered up to the committee
of the county or town wherein they shall be imported, to be
stored at the risk of the importer, until the non-importation agreement
shall cease, or be sold under the direction of the committee
aforesaid; and in the last mentioned case the owner or owners of such
goods shall be reimbursed out of the sales, the first cost and charges,
the profits, if any, to be applied towards relieving and employing such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
poor inhabitants of the town of Boston as are immediate sufferers by
the Boston port bill, and a particular account of all goods so returned,
stored or sold, to be inserted in the public paper; and if any goods or
merchandise shall be imported after the said first day of February,
the same ought forthwith to be sent back again without breaking any
of the packages thereof.</p>

<p><i>Eleventh.</i> That a committee be chosen in every county, city and
town, by those who are qualified to vote for representatives in the
legislature, whose business it shall be attentively to observe the conduct
of all persons touching this association, and when it shall be
made to appear to the satisfaction of a majority of any such committee,
that any person within the limits of their appointment has violated
this association, that such majority do forthwith cause the truth of the
case to be published in the gazette, to the end that all such foes to
the rights of British America may be publicly known and universally
condemned as the enemies of American liberty, and henceforth we
respectively will break off all dealings with him or her.</p>

<p><i>Twelfth.</i> That the committee of correspondence in the respective
colonies do frequently inspect the entries of the custom house, and
inform each other from time to time of the true state thereof, and of
every other material circumstance that may occur relative to this
association.</p>

<p><i>Thirteenth.</i> That all manufactures of this country be sold at
reasonable prices, so that no under-advantage be taken of a future
scarcity of goods.</p>

<p><i>Fourteenth.</i> And we do further agree and resolve, that we will
have no trade, commerce, dealings, or intercourse whatsoever with
any colony or province in North America which shall not accede to,
or which shall have hereafter violated this association, but will hold
them as unworthy of the rights of freemen and inimicable to the rights
of their country.</p>

<p>And we do solemnly bind ourselves and our constituents, under the
ties aforesaid, to adhere to this association until such parts of the
several acts of parliament passed since the close of the war, as impose
or continue duties on tea, wine, molasses, sirups, coffee, sugar, pimento,
indigo, foreign paper, glass, and painters’ colours, imported into
America, and extend the powers of the admiralty courts beyond their
ancient limits, deprive the American subjects of trial by jury, authorize
the judge’s certificate to indemnify the prosecutor from damages
that he might otherwise be liable to from a trial by his peers, require
oppressive security from a claimant of ships or goods before he shall
be allowed to defend his property, are repealed.</p>

<p>And we recommend it to the provincial conventions and to the
committee in the respective colonies, to establish such further regulations
as they may think proper for carrying into execution this association.”</p>

<p>Upon this report all the subsequent proceedings of the Congress
were predicated. We may readily suppose, that nothing but the most
unparalleled violations of their rights, could induce men to enter into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
an agreement like the above. By every true patriot it was closely adhered
to.</p>

<p>After a session of about two months, Congress adjourned to meet
the ensuing May, when Mr. Hewes again took his seat in that body
and became conspicuous as a member of important committees. He
was continued at this post of honour the ensuing year and had the
satisfaction of hearing the discussion upon the momentous question of
a separation from Great Britain. He was decidedly in favour of the
measure, and when the set time arrived to strike for liberty, he sanctioned
the declaration of independence by his vote and signature.</p>

<p>He now became a very conspicuous actor upon committees. His
industry, his accurate knowledge of business, his systematic mode of
performing all his duties, gained for him the esteem and admiration of
all the members. It was remarked by one of his cotemporaries: “Mr.
Hewes was remarkable for a devotedness to the business of this” (the
secret) “committee, as ever the most industrious merchant was to his
counting-house.”</p>

<p>He was upon the committee of claims, upon the secret committee,
upon the one to consult with Washington relative to military operations,
upon that of the treasury and several others. The one upon
which he rendered the most important services, was that which had
charge of fitting out a naval armament. The whole business eventually
devolved upon him and he was, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de facto</i>, the first secretary of the
navy. With the funds placed in his hands he fitted out with great
despatch eight armed vessels. He was also very active in obtaining
supplies for his own state. Indeed so deeply did he feel for
his constituents in North Carolina, that he declined his appointment
to Congress in 1777, and repaired to her assistance, where he remained
until July, 1779, when he again resumed his seat in the national
legislature. He was then worn down with fatigue and in poor health.
He endeavoured to resume his active duties, but disease had already
shaken his physical powers and sown the seeds of death. He continued
to attend in the house, when able, until the 29th of October,
when he saw its hall for the last time. On the 10th of November, his
immortal spirit left its earthly tabernacle and returned to Him who
gave it. His premature death was deeply lamented and sincerely
mourned. Congress passed the usual resolutions and its members
wore the mourning badge for thirty days. His remains were buried
in Christ Church yard, Philadelphia, followed by all the members
and officers of Congress, the general assembly and supreme executive
council of Pennsylvania, the minister plenipotentiary of France,
the military and a large concourse of other persons. The funeral
ceremony was performed by the Reverend Mr. White, since Bishop
White, and the chaplain of the Continental Congress. His dust
reposes in peace, his name is recorded on the chart of our liberty, his
fame will live until the last vestige of American history shall be
blotted from the world. Not a blemish rests upon his private character
or public reputation.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_57">JOHN ADAMS.</h2>
</div>

<p>Genuine moral courage is a sterling quality that ennobles and dignifies
the man. It invigorates the mind like an impregning cloud—shedding
its gentle dews on the flowers of spring. It is a heavenly
spark, animating the immortal soul with the fire of divinity that illuminates
the path of rectitude. It is an attribute that opposes all
wrong and propels its subject right onward to the fearless performance
of all right. It is based upon virtue and equity, and spurns vice
in all its borrowed and delusive forms. It courts no servile favours—it
fears no earthly scrutiny. No flattery can seduce it, no eclat
can allure it, no bribe can purchase it, no tyrant can awe it, no misfortune
can bend it, no intrigue can corrupt it, no adversity can quench
it, no tortures can subdue it. Its motto is—“<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Fiat justitia, ruat
cœlum</i>.” [Let justice be done though the heavens should fall.] Without
it, fame is ephemeral and renown transient. It is the saline basis
of a good name that gives richness to its memory. It is a pillar of light
to revolving thought, and the polar star that points to duty and leads
to merit. It is the soul of reason, the essence of wisdom, and the
crowning glory of mental power. It was this that influenced the
signers of the declaration of independence and nerved them for the
conflict.</p>

<p>No one among them was more fully imbued with it than <span class="smcap">John
Adams</span>. He was a native of Quincy, Massachusetts, and born on the
19th of October, (O.&nbsp;S.) 1735. He was the fourth in descent from
Henry Adams, whose tomb bears this singular inscription—“He took
his flight from the dragon persecution, in Devonshire, England, and
alighted, with eight sons, near Mount Wollaston.” In childhood the
career of John Adams was marked with a rapid developement of strong
intellectual powers, which were skilfully cultivated by Mr. Marsh,
at Braintree, a celebrated and successful teacher. At the age of sixteen
years he entered Harvard College, at Cambridge, where he became
a finished scholar and graduated at the age of twenty. He gained
a high reputation for frankness, honesty and untiring industry, and
was greatly esteemed by the professors and his classmates.</p>

<p>From college he proceeded to Worcester, commenced the study
of law under Mr. Putnam, and finished with Mr. Gridley, supporting
himself in the mean time by teaching a grammar class. At that early
age he possessed wisdom to perceive right, and moral courage to pursue
it. In view of the past and present, he made a philosophic grasp
at the future, as will appear from the following extract from a letter
written by him on the 12th of October, 1755, shortly after he took up
his residence at Worcester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
“Soon after the reformation a few people came over into this new
world for conscience sake. Perhaps this apparently trivial incident
may transfer the great seat of empire into America. It looks likely
to me, if we can remove the turbulent Gallics, our people, according
to the exactest computations, will, in another century, become more
numerous than England herself. Should this be the case, since we
have, I may say, all the naval stores of the nation in our hands, it will
be easy to obtain the mastery of the seas, and then the united force of
all Europe will not be able to subdue us. The only way to keep us
from setting up for ourselves—is to disunite us. * * * Keep us
in distinct colonies, and then some men in each colony, desiring the
monarchy of the whole, will destroy each other’s influence and keep
the country in equilibrio.”</p>

<p>This broad and expansive view of the future, conceived by a youth,
was very remarkable. He saw the one thing needful to render our
nation powerful—the creation of a navy—for which nature has given
us all the stores. The paralysis that pervades our government in its
naval improvements has long astonished the nations of the old world,
and a <em>few</em> of our own statesmen. The time <em>will</em> arrive when our country
will be made to feel most keenly—that “a navy is the right arm
of defence.”</p>

<p>After pursuing his studies three years, Mr. Adams was admitted to
the practice of law. He then commenced his professional career at
Braintree. Questions of constitutional right and law had already become
the subject of investigation and a root of bitterness between the
colonists and the officers of the crown. The latter, that were engaged
in the custom-house, claimed unlimited power to search the private
dwellings of all persons whom they suspected of having dutiable goods.
This suspicion, or pretended suspicion, often arose from personal animosity,
without a shadow of evidence or reasonable cause. The right of
search was of course resisted as arbitrary, unconstitutional and assumed.
This led to an application to the superior court for “writs of assistance,”
which may be considered as one of the first germs of the revolution.
Mr. Gridley, who had led Mr. Adams to the bar, and was
then his friend and admirer, maintained the legality of the proceeding,
not upon the ground of constitutional law, but from the necessity of
the case in order to protect the revenue. Mr. Adams took a deep
interest in the question, which was finally argued before the superior
court at Boston, by Mr. Gridley for the crown and Mr. Otis for the
people. In listening to the latter gentleman, a fire of patriotism was
kindled in the bosom of Mr. Adams, that death alone could extinguish.
He asserted in after life, that “Mr. Otis’s oration against writs of
assistance, breathed into this nation the breath of life. * * * American
independence was then and there born. * * * Every man of
an immense crowded audience appeared to me to go away, as I did,
ready to take up arms against writs of assistance. Then and there
was the first scene of the first act of opposition to the arbitrary claims
of Great Britain.”</p>

<p>The court <em>publicly</em> decided against the writs, but <em>secretly</em> issued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
them. That people had their houses searched to satisfy revenge, will
appear from the following described incident.</p>

<p>“Mr. Justice Wally had called Mr. Ware, one of the persons in
possession of such a writ, before him, by a constable, to answer for a
breach of the Sabbath-day acts, or for profane swearing. As soon as
he had finished, Mr. Ware asked him if he had done. He replied—yes.
Well, then, said Mr. Ware, I will show you a little of <em>my</em>
power. I command you to permit me to search your house for uncustomed
goods—and went on to search his house from garret to cellar—and
then served the constable in the same manner.”</p>

<p>We can readily imagine the natural consequences of such a procedure,
against which Mr. Adams at once took a bold and decided stand.
The assembly also interfered in behalf of the people, and in 1762 prepared
a bill to prevent these writs from being issued to any but custom-house
officers, and to them only upon a specific information on
oath—which bill was vetoed by the governor. As a blow at the royal
authority this was well aimed, and showed a disposition in the members
to do the will of their constituents. As a retaliative measure
they reduced the salary of the judges.</p>

<p>In 1761, Mr. Adams attained the rank of barrister and rose to eminence
in his profession. In 1764, he married the accomplished Miss
Abigail, the daughter of the Rev. William Smith, who participated
with him in the changing scenes of life for fifty-four years. The following
extract from a letter written by her to a friend, after the commencement
of the revolution, will exhibit the strength of her mind
and the patriotic feelings of the ladies at that eventful era.</p>

<p>“Heaven is our witness that we do not rejoice in the effusion of
blood or the carnage of the human species—but, having been forced to
draw the sword, we are determined never to sheathe it—<em>slaves to Britain</em>.
Our cause, sir, I trust, is the cause of truth and justice, and will
finally prevail, though the combined force of earth and hell should rise
against it. To this cause I have sacrificed much of my own personal
happiness, by giving up to the councils of America one of my nearest
connexions, and living for more than three years in a state of widowhood.”</p>

<p>When the stamp act was passed, the fire of indignation against lawless
oppression rose in the bosom of Mr. Adams to a luminous flame.
He at once became a public man, and entered into a defence of chartered
rights and rational freedom. He published an “Essay on the
Canon and Feudal Law,” which placed him on a lofty eminence as
an able and vigorous writer. Its raciness penetrated the joints and
marrow of royal power as practised, and the parliamentary legislation
as assumed. He traced the former law to its original source—the
Roman clergy—by them subtlely planned, extensively exercised and
acutely managed, to effect their own aggrandizement. He then delineated
the servile dogmas of the latter, that made each manor the
miniature kingdom of a petty tyrant. He then drew a vivid picture
of their powerful but unholy confederacy, by which they spread the
mantle of ignorance over the world, drove virtue from the earth, and
commenced the era of mental obscurity. He then explored the labyrinthian
mazes of the dark ages, portrayed the first glimmerings of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
returning light, travelled through the gigantic struggles of the reformation
amidst the bloody scenes of cruel persecution, and finally
placed his readers upon the granite shores of New England, where,
for a century, liberty had shed its happy influence upon the sons and
daughters of freemen, unmolested by canons or feuds. That liberty
was now invaded, and, unless the tyranny that had already commenced
its desolating course was arrested in its bold career, slavery
would be the consequence. This is the syllabus of a pamphlet of over
forty pages, written in a strong, bold and nervous style.</p>

<p>From that time forward Mr. Adams became a leading whig. He became
associated with Samuel Adams, Quincy, Otis and other kindred
spirits, all much older men, but not more zealous in the cause than him.
The repeal of the odious stamp act and the removal of Mr. Grenville
from the ministry was the result of the labours of the patriots in 1765.
A delusive calm ensued in parliamentary and ministerial proceedings,
openly avowed. Mr. Adams was among those who watched closely
the signs of the times. Governor Barnard occasionally showed the
cloven foot, and his officers put on airs that were far from being agreeable
to the yeomanry of the country. Festering wounds occasionally
became irritated, and no balm was found that restored them to perfect
soundness.</p>

<p>In 1766 Mr. Adams removed to Boston, and at the end of two
years had become so conspicuous and had displayed so much talent
that the governor thought him worth purchasing. The lucrative and
honourable office of advocate-general in the court of admiralty was
offered to him, which was deemed a sufficient bribe to allure him.
In this the governor found himself mistaken. Moral courage was the
firm basis on which this devoted patriot stood. He spurned the royal
harness, glittering with gold, with as much disdain as the wild horse
of the prairie looks upon a moping mule.</p>

<p>In 1769 he was one of the committee appointed by the citizens of
Boston to propose instructions for their representatives in the legislative
body, which were highly spiced with free principles, and were
very unsavoury to the royal governor. Many of his measures were
severely censured, particularly that of quartering the mercenary soldiers
in the town. He was unbending in his purposes, and the people
determined on maintaining their rights. The consequences were
tragical. On the fifth of March, 1770, an affray occurred between
the military and citizens, in which five of the latter were killed and
others wounded. The following description of the scene that ensued
is from the pen of Mr. Adams, the present subject of this memoir.</p>

<p>“The people assembled first at Faneuil Hall and adjourned to the
old South Church, to the number, as was conjectured, of ten or twelve
hundred men, among whom were the most virtuous, substantial, independent,
disinterested and intelligent citizens. They formed themselves
into a regular deliberative body, chose their moderator and
secretary, entered into discussions, deliberations and debates, adopted
resolutions and appointed committees. Their resolutions in public
were conformable to every man in private who dared express his
thoughts or his feelings—‘that the regular soldiers should be banished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
from the town at all hazards.’ Jonathan Williams, a very pious,
inoffensive and conscientious gentleman, was their moderator. A
remonstrance to the governor, or governor and council, was ordained,
and a demand that the regular troops should be removed from the
town. A committee was appointed to present this remonstrance, of
which <i>Samuel Adams</i> was chairman.</p>

<p>“This was a delicate and dangerous crisis. The question in the
last resort was—whether the town of Boston should become a scene
of carnage and desolation or not. Humanity to the soldiers conspired
with a regard for the safety of the town, in suggesting the
measure in calling the town together to deliberate, for nothing but
the most solemn promises to the people, that the soldiers should, at
all hazards, be driven from the town, had preserved its peace. Not
only the immense assemblies of the people from day to day, but military
arrangements from night to night were necessary to keep the
people and the soldiers from getting together by the ears. The life
of a red coat would not have been safe in any street or corner of the
town; nor would the lives of the inhabitants been much more secure.
The whole militia of the city was in requisition, and military watches
and guards were every where placed. We were all upon a level;
no man was exempted; our military officers were our only superiors.
I had the honour to be summoned in my turn and attended at the
State-house with my musket and bayonet, my broad sword and cartridge
box, under the command of the famous Paddock. I know you
will laugh at my military figure; but I believe there was not a more
obedient soldier in the regiment, nor one more impartial between the
people and the regulars. In this character I was upon duty all
night in my turn. No man appeared more anxious or more deeply
impressed with a sense of danger on all sides than our commander
Paddock. He called me, common soldier as I was, frequently to
his councils. I had a great deal of conversation with him, and no
man appeared more apprehensive of a fatal calamity to the town, or
more zealous by every prudent measure to prevent it.”<a id="FNanchor_G" href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">G</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_G" href="#FNanchor_G" class="fnanchor">G</a> For the further proceedings, see Samuel Adams and John Hancock.</p></div>

<p>Order was finally restored and the civil authorities again assumed
their functions. Captain Preston was arrested and brought before
the court, charged with giving the order to the regulars to fire upon
the citizens; and also the soldiers who committed the outrage. As
is uniformly the case, each party was charged with blame by the
respective friends of the other. Some inconsiderate citizens had
thrown snowballs at the king’s troops, who returned the change in
blue pills. The former were imprudent, the latter were revengeful.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams was employed by the accused to defend them. Some
of his friends were fearful that it might injure his popularity with the
people, whose excitement was still very great. But so ingeniously
and eloquently did he manage the case, that Captain Preston and all
the soldiers but two were acquitted, and those two were only convicted
of manslaughter, and Mr. Adams stood approved and applauded
by the citizens, having performed his professional duty to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
his clients, and at the same time vindicated the rights of the people;
the result of being guided entirely by the polar star of moral courage.</p>

<p>The same year he was elected to the legislative body, then called
the “General Court,” and was a bold opposer of the arbitrary measures
of Lieutenant-governor Hutchinson, who undisguisedly followed
the directions of the ministry in violation of the charter of the
colony, in all things that were necessary to carry out the plans of the
British cabinet, pleading his instructions as an excuse.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams was one of the committee that prepared an address to
him, the style of which induces me to think it was penned by him.
From the following extract the reader may judge. After vividly
portraying the violations of right complained of, the address concludes,
“These and other grievances and cruelties, too many to be
here enumerated, and too melancholy to <em>be much longer borne</em> by
this injured people, we have seen brought upon us by the devices of
ministers of state. And we have, of late, seen and heard of <em>instructions</em>
to governors which threaten to destroy all the remaining privileges
of our charter. Should these struggles of the house prove
unfortunate and ineffectual, this province will submit, with pious
resignation, to the will of <em>Providence</em>; but it would be a kind of suicide,
of which we have the utmost abhorrence, to be instrumental in
our own servitude.” A blind obstinacy on the part of the ministers
increased the opposition of the people and operated upon them with
all the power of centrifugal force, inducing them to refuse obedience
to the king’s officers. Alarmed at the boldness of the people of
Boston, Governor Barnard had ordered the general court to convene
at Cambridge. This was contrary to the charter which fixed its place
of meeting at the former place. The members convened but refused
to proceed to business unless they were permitted to adjourn to the
proper place, to which Lieutenant-governor Hutchinson, who had
succeeded Governor Barnard, refused his assent. A war of words
and paper ensued, in which the patriots were uniformly victorious.
Mr. Adams was a leader of the sharp-shooters and made great havoc
among the officers of the crown. They induced the senior member
of their council, Mr. Brattle, to enter the field against him with
pen in hand. The conflict was short, Mr. Adams put him <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de
combat</i>, and showed the people the fallacy of every pretext set up by
the hirelings of the ministry. In 1771, Mr. Hutchinson was appointed
governor, and the next year consented to the return of the
legislative body to Boston as a balm for the wounds he had inflicted.
But in this he gained no popularity—it was deemed an involuntary
act forced upon him by the popular will, or a mere stratagem to quiet
the public mind. There were other sources of complaint. The troops
in the castle, that were under the pay and control of the province,
had been dismissed and their place supplied by fresh regulars from
the mother country: the governor and judges received their salaries
from England instead of from the colony, as had always been the
usage, thus aiming to render the military, executive and judiciary
independent of the people whom they governed, which operated as
a talisman to destroy all confidence and affection for these officers on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
the part of the citizens. The tax on tea was another source of grief
that touched more tender chords. Woe unto the ruler that rouses
the indignation of the better part of creation. He had better tempt
the fury of Mars, or try his speed with Atalanta. Tea soon became
forbidden fruit, and several vessel loads were sacrificed to Neptune
as an oblation for the sins of ministers and an oblectation for the fishes
of Boston harbour. Royal authority increased in insolence, and the
patriots increased in boldness. At the commencement of the session
of the general court in 1773, Governor Hutchinson sustained the
odious doctrine of supremacy of the parliament in his message, which
was promptly replied to and denied by the members of that body.
A reply was as promptly returned by his excellency, which was prepared
with more than usual ability. Mr. Adams, although not a
member at that time, was employed to write a rejoinder, which
was adopted without any amendment. It paralyzed the pen and
closed the mouth of the governor. It was an exposition of British
wrongs and American rights so clearly exhibited, that no sophistry
could impugn it or logic confront it. So highly was it appreciated
by Dr. Franklin, that he had it republished in England and freely
circulated. It was a luminary to the patriots and confusion to their
opponents.</p>

<p>Shortly after, Mr. Adams was elected to the general court and
placed on the list of committees. So vindictive was governor Hutchinson,
that he erased his name—an act that recoiled upon himself with
redoubled force and aided to hasten the termination of his power in
the colony. In less than a year from that time he was succeeded by
governor Gage, who was still better calculated to hasten on the revolutionary
crisis—because more authoritative and ministerial than his
predecessor. With the commencement of his limited administration
in 1774, the Boston port bill took effect. The consequences that
followed are familiar to the reader. Governor Gage embraced the
first opportunity to pay a marked attention to John Adams. His
name was placed on the council list at the first session of the legislature,
after his excellency assumed the helm of government, who at
once placed his indignant cross upon it. He also removed the
assembly to Salem. The members proceeded to the preliminary
business of the session, and among other things requested the governor
to fix a day for general humiliation and prayer, which he peremptorily
refused to do. Here again tender chords were touched. The
people <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i> venerated religion, and an insult upon that or an interruption
of its usual and ancient usages, was like adding pitch to a
fire already vivid and flaming. The house then proceeded to consider
the project of a general Congress, and in spite of an attempt by the
governor to dissolve it, the door was locked against his secretary,
patriotic resolutions were passed, and five delegates appointed to meet
a national convention, one of which was John Adams. So bold had
been his course that some of his warmest friends and most ardent admirers
advised him to decline his appointment, as the adherents of the
crown had already hinted that he evidently aimed at establishing an
independent government, which they considered endangered the peace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
of the country and his life, as the British could and would enforce
every measure they chose to adopt. But John Adams had weighed
well the subject of rights and wrongs and took his stand within the
citadel of <span class="smcap smaller">MORAL COURAGE</span>, against which the gates of hell can never
prevail. He had resolved to nobly perish in defending the liberty of
his country, or plant the standard of freedom on the ruins of tyranny.</p>

<p>At the appointed time he repaired to the city of Philadelphia and
took his seat in that assemblage of sages whose wisdom has been sung
by the ablest poets, applauded by the most eloquent orators, and admired
by the most sagacious statesmen of the two hemispheres. On
reading the proceedings of the American Congress of 1774, Lord
Chatham remarked, “that he had studied and admired the free states
of antiquity, the master spirits of the world—but that for solidity of
reasoning, force of sagacity and wisdom of conclusion, no body of
men could stand in preference to this congress.”</p>

<p>Mr. Adams, for whom his friends felt so much anxiety for fear his
ardour might lead him to rashness, was as calm as a summer morning,
but firm as the granite shores of his birth place. With all his ardent
zeal he was discreet, prudent and politic. He was the last man to
violate constitutional law, and the last man to submit to its violation.
He kept his helm hard up and ran close to the wind, but understood
well when to luff and when to take the larboard tack, and when to
take in sail. His soundings were deep and his calculations relative
to future storms were truly prophetic. He was one of the few that
believed the ministry would induce the king and parliament of the
mother country to remain incorrigible, and that petitions would be
vain, addresses futile, and remonstrances unavailing. That this Congress
adopted the proper course to pursue, he was fully aware—that
dignity might grace the cause of the people and justice be honoured.
The following extract from a letter written by him at a subsequent
period, shows his, and the conclusions of others at that time.</p>

<p>“When Congress had finished their business as they thought, in
the autumn of 1774, I had with Mr. Henry before we took leave of
each other some familiar conversation, in which I expressed a full
conviction that our resolves, declarations of rights, enumeration of
wrongs, petitions, remonstrances, addresses, associations and non-importation
agreements, however they might be accepted in America and
however necessary to cement the union of the colonies, would be
waste water in England. Mr. Henry said, they might make some
impression among the <em>people</em> of England, but agreed with me that
they would be totally lost upon the <em>government</em>. I had just received
a short and hasty letter, written to me by Major Joseph Hawley of
Northampton, containing ‘a few broken hints,’ as he called them, of
what he thought was proper to be done, and concluding with these
words, ‘<em>after all we must fight</em>.’ This letter I read to Mr. Henry,
who listened with great attention, and as soon as I had pronounced
the words:—‘<em>after all we must fight</em>’—he raised his hand and with an
energy and vehemence that I can never forget, broke out with—‘by
G—d I am of that man’s mind.’ * * * * *</p>

<p>The other delegates from Virginia returned to their state in full<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
confidence that all our grievances would be redressed. The last
words that Mr. Richard Henry Lee said to me when we parted, were
‘we shall infallibly carry all our points. You will be completely relieved—all
the offensive acts will be repealed, the army and fleet
will be recalled and Britain will give up her foolish project.’ Washington
only was in doubt. He never spoke in public. In private he
joined with those who advocated a non-exportation, as well as a non-importation
agreement. With <em>both</em> he thought we should prevail—with
either he thought it doubtful. Henry was clear in one opinion, Richard
Henry Lee in an opposite opinion, and Washington doubted between
the two.”</p>

<p>Here is exhibited a striking picture of the minds of these four great
men, which appears to have escaped the notice of the several writers
that I have consulted. Adams and Henry, drawing their conclusions
from the past, the present and the future, diving into the
depths of human nature and grasping, at one bold view, all the multiform
circumstances that hung over the two nations, concluded truly,
“<em>after all we must fight</em>.” They concluded that the confidence inspired
in the ministers by the overwhelming physical force of Great
Britain, would prevent them from relaxing the cords of oppression,
and that the independent spirit of the hardy sons of Columbia would
not be subdued without a struggle. Lee, naturally bouyant, his own
mind readily impressed by reason and eloquence, did not reflect that
inflated power, when deluded by obstinacy and avarice, is callous to
all the refined feelings of the heart, is deaf to wisdom and blind to
justice. He was as determined to maintain chartered rights as them,
but did not scan human nature as closely. Washington, deep in reflection
and investigation, his soul overflowing with the milk of human
kindness, did not arrive as rapidly at conclusions. In weighing
the causes of difference between the two countries, reason, justice
and hope on the one side, power, corruption, and avarice on the other,
held his mind, for a time, in equilibrio. He plainly perceived and
pursued the right, and fondly but faintly hoped that England would
see and pursue it too. He was as prompt to defend liberty as either
of the others.</p>

<p>On his return, Mr. Adams was congratulated by his anxious friends
upon the prudent course he had pursued, and was re-elected a member
of the ensuing Congress. During the interim his pen was again usefully
employed. Mr. Sewall, the king’s attorney-general, had written
a series of elaborate and ingenious essays, maintaining the supremacy
of parliament and censuring, in no measured terms, the proceedings
of the whigs. Under the name of “Novanglus,” Mr. Adams
stripped the gay ornaments and gaudy apparel from the high-varnished
picture that Mr. Sewall had presented to the public, and when he had
finished his work, a mere skeleton of visible deformity was left to
gaze upon.</p>

<p>The attorney-general was made to tremble before the keen cuts of
the falchion quill of this devoted patriot. So deep was his reasoning,
so learned were his expositions, and so lucid and conclusive were his
demonstrations, that his antagonist exclaimed, as he retired hissing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
from the conflict, “he strives to hide his inconsistencies under a huge
pile of learning.” The pile proved too huge for royal power, and
was sufficiently large to supply the people with an abundance of light.
The supremacy of parliament was an unfortunate issue for ministers.
It left the sages of liberty in a position to hurl their arrows freely at
<em>them</em>, without denying the allegiance of the colonists to the <em>king</em>. The
British cabinet worked out its own destruction, if not with fear and
trembling, it was with blindness and disgrace—a disgrace arising from
the grossest impolicy and injustice, if not to say ignorance and infatuation.
They were entirely mistaken in the people of America—they
awoke the wrong passengers.</p>

<p>In May, 1775, Mr. Adams again took his seat in Congress. The
members convened under quite different feelings from those that
pervaded their bosoms the previous autumn. Revolution was now
rolling fearfully upon their bleeding country, hope of redress was expiring
like the last flickerings of an exhausted taper, dark and portentous
clouds were accumulating, the ministerial ermine was already
steeped in blood, the chains of servitude were clanking in their ears,
the dying groans of their fellow citizens and the mournful lamentations
of widows and orphans were resounding through the land, and
the prophetic conclusion of Adams and Henry, drawn at the previous
session, began to force itself upon the minds of members, that “<em>after
all we must fight</em>.” As a preliminary measure, it was necessary to
appoint a commander of the military forces to be raised. To fix
upon the <em>best</em> man was of vital importance. Many were yet chanting
the song of peace and thought it premature to make such an appointment,
lest it should widen the breach which they still hoped
might be repaired. The New England delegates were not of this
class. When the purple current was wantonly diverted from its original
channel upon the heights of Lexington, they hung their syren
harps upon the weeping willows that shaded the tombs of their murdered
brethren. They were convinced that war was inevitable.
All soon became satisfied that prudence dictated a preparation for
such an event. A suitable man to lead the armies and direct their
course was a desideratum. The southern members were willing to
submit to any nomination made by the eastern delegates. General
Artemas Ward of Massachusetts was fixed upon by most of them,
except John Adams. In George Washington he had discovered the
commingling qualities of a philanthropist, a philosopher, a statesman
and a hero. He was prompted by the force of moral courage to at
once urge his colleagues to sanction his choice. They were all opposed
to it, as were also the other members of the northern and eastern
delegation. Mr. Adams was firm in his purpose, and met every objection
with conclusive arguments. These discussions were all private,
not a word was uttered on the floor of Congress as to who
should be the man. At last Samuel Adams became convinced that
his junior colleague was right. The work was soon accomplished.
Satisfied that his measure would be supported by a majority, John
Adams rose in Congress and proposed that a commander of the
American armies should be appointed. When this resolution was
passed, he proceeded to portray the requisite qualities necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
fit a man for this important station, and emphatically remarked
“<em>such a man is within these walls</em>.” But few knew who he was
about to nominate, and could not imagine who among their own
number was possessed of all these noble attainments. A transient
pause ensued. A breathless anxiety produced a painful suspense.
The next moment the name of <span class="smcap">Colonel George Washington</span> of
Virginia, was announced, at which the colonel was more astonished
than any other member of the house. He had not received an intimation
of the intended honour from any person. He was nominated
by John Adams about the middle of June, the nomination was seconded
by Samuel Adams, the next day the vote was taken and was
unanimous in his favour. This appointment originated entirely with
Mr. Adams; a high encomium upon his deep penetration and discernment
of human intellect, a clear demonstration of his moral courage
manifested in persevering in his choice although opposed at the
threshold by the entire New England delegation. So judicious and
felicitous was this selection, that the revered La Fayette remarked,
“it was the consequence of providential inspiration.” Be it so; Mr.
Adams was the happy medium through which it was communicated
to the Continental Congress, thereby placing at the head of the American
armies just such a man as the crisis required—prudent, dignified,
bold, sagacious, patient, persevering, and universally esteemed
by the patriots, and admired even by the most violent adherents of
the crown.</p>

<p>After Mr. Adams had accomplished this important act, he remained
apparently quiescent during the residue of the session, viewing, analyzing
and scanning public feeling and public acts.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1776, he took his seat a third time in the National
Assembly. The period had then arrived for more decisive action.
Massachusetts had been declared out of the king’s protection by parliament.
England had hired legions of soldiers from German princes
to subdue the rebels in America, the last note of peace had died upon
the voice of echo, every ray of hope in favour of an amicable settlement
was banished, and every member became convinced that the
dilemma was, <em>resistance or slavery</em>; but there were many who shrunk
back with astonishment when independence was named to them.</p>

<p>At this juncture Mr. Adams marked out a bold course and had
moral courage to pursue it. On the sixth of May he offered a resolution
in Congress proposing that the colonies should organize governments
independent of the mother country. On the tenth of the
same month its substance was adopted in a modified form, recommending
the formation of such government by the colonies “as might
be conducive to the happiness and safety of their constituents in particular
and America in general.”</p>

<p>This startling measure was at first ably opposed by many of the
patriots as premature, admitting its justice, and, but for the weakness
of the colonies, its propriety and necessity. But Mr. Adams knew
no middle course. He had succeeded in obtaining the adoption of
the preface to his broad and expanding folio of an independent compact,
and he proceeded to put the main matter to press. He rose like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
giant and commenced the mighty work of political regeneration. Each
succeeding day brought him new aid. From the legislature of his own
state he received full permission to strike for independence. North
Carolina had declared first, Virginia followed, and on the seventh of
June, Richard Henry Lee became the organ to lay the proposition
fairly before Congress. A most animated discussion ensued. Then
it was that the powers of Mr. Adams were fully developed. Mr.
Jefferson said of him when alluding to his able support of the declaration
of independence, “John Adams was the pillar of its support
on the floor of Congress; its ablest advocate and defender against
the multifarious assaults it encountered. He was our Colossus on
the floor; not graceful, not elegant, not always fluent in his public
addresses; yet he came out with a power, both of thought and of expression,
that moved us from our seats.” Another writer remarks,
I think Mr. Trumbull, “The eloquence of Mr. Adams resembled his
general character. It was bold, manly and energetic, such as the
crisis required.” The noblest powers of the soul of John Adams
were raised to the zenith of their strength to accomplish the mighty
work before him. Although on the committee to prepare the manifesto
of eternal separation, he confided its preparation to his colleagues
and bent his whole force, eloquence and energy upon the
opponents to the measure. Most manfully did he contend, most gloriously
did he triumph. He bore down upon his adversaries like a
mountain torrent, a sweeping avalanche, prostrating their arguments
and answering their objections in a manner that left no trace behind.
He hurled the arrows of conviction so thick and fast, that every heart
was pierced and a majority subdued. At length the time arrived
when the momentous subject must be decided. The fourth of July,
1776, dawned upon the patriots; they assembled, the past, the present
and the prospective future rushed upon their minds; moments
flew, hearts beat quicker, the question was put, independence was
declared, America was free, liberty was honoured, freedom was proclaimed
and a nation redeemed.</p>

<p>The following copy of a letter written by Mr. Adams to his wife on
the 5th of July, will show the feelings of his mind on that occasion:</p>

<p>“Yesterday the greatest question was decided that was ever debated
in America, and greater, perhaps, never was or will be decided
among men. A resolution passed without one dissenting colony—‘that
these United States are, and of right ought to be, free and independent
states.’ The day is passed. The fourth of July, 1776, will
be a memorable epoch in the history of America. I am apt to believe
it will be celebrated by succeeding generations, as the great anniversary
festival. It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance,
by solemn acts of devotion to Almighty God. It ought to
be solemnized with pomps, shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires
and illuminations, from one end of the continent to the other,
from this time forward and for ever. You will think me transported
with enthusiasm, but I am not. I am well aware of the toil, and
blood, and treasure, that it will cost to maintain this declaration and
support and defend these states; yet, through all the gloom, I can see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
the rays of light and glory. I can see that the end is worth more
than all the means, and that posterity will triumph, although you and
I may rue, which I hope we shall not.”</p>

<p>Early in the winter of 1776, Mr. Adams sketched a form of government
to be adopted by each colony, which was substantially the
same as the constitutions of the present time. It was in a letter to
Richard Henry Lee, by whom it was, by permission, published without
a name, and may be considered as the model of the constitutions
now in force in the different states. After the form he remarks,
“A constitution founded on these principles, introduces knowledge
among the people and inspires them with a conscious dignity becoming
freemen. A general emulation takes place which causes good
humour, sociability, good manners and good morals to be general.
That elevation of sentiment inspired by such a government, makes
the common people brave and enterprising. That ambition which is
inspired by it makes them sober, industrious and frugal. You will
find among them some elegance perhaps, but more solidity; a little
pleasure but a great deal of business; some politeness but more civility.
If you compare such a country with the regions of domination,
whether monarchial or aristocratical, you will fancy yourself in Arcadia
or Elysium.”</p>

<p>Here, upon the canvass of truth, is a complete picture, exhibiting
the blessings derived from a government like our own in its <em>principles</em>—that
these principles are not strictly adhered to by all politicians,
is a fact too fully and fearfully demonstrated. Among all the great men
of the last century of increasing intellectual light, no one appears to
have taken a more comprehensive and at the same time minute view
of human nature and of human government, than John Adams. He
traced causes and effects through all their labyrinthian meanderings,
and drew conclusions as if by inspiration. Many of his predictions of
the future bear the impress of prophecy, and show how deeply he investigated
and the clearness of his perception.</p>

<p>On his return from Congress at the close of the session, he was
chosen a member of the council of Massachusetts under the new constitution,
and aided to organize a free government on a basis purely
republican. He was also appointed chief justice, but declined serving.</p>

<p>In 1777, Mr. Adams resumed his seat in Congress, and engaged in
a course of labour unparalleled in the history of legislation. He was
an acting member of ninety committees, chairman of twenty-five,
chairman of the board of war and of appeals, discharged all those multifarious
duties promptly, besides participating in the debates of the
house upon all important questions. In December of that year he was
appointed a commissioner to France, and embarked on board of the frigate
Boston in February following, from his native town at the foot of
Mount Wollaston. During the voyage a British armed ship was discovered,
and, by the consent of Mr. Adams, Captain Tucker gave
chase, strictly enjoining the commissioner to keep out of danger. No
sooner had the action commenced than Mr. Adams seized a musket
and gave the enemy a well directed shot. The captain discovering
him in his exposed situation, said to him, “I am commanded by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
Continental Congress to carry you in safety to Europe, and I will do
it,” and very pleasantly removed him and placed him out of danger.</p>

<p>On his arrival at France he had the satisfaction to learn that Dr.
Franklin and his colleagues had succeeded in concluding a treaty of
alliance with the French nation. He continued in Europe a little
more than a year and then returned home. Soon after his arrival he
was elected to a convention of his native state convened for the purpose
of perfecting a constitution for the more complete organization
of its government. He was upon the committee to prepare this document,
and was selected to make the draught. He produced an instrument
similar to that sketched for Richard Henry Lee in January
1776, which was sanctioned and adopted. Before his duties had terminated
in this convention he was appointed by Congress “a minister
plenipotentiary for negotiating a treaty of peace and a treaty of commerce
with Great Britain.”</p>

<p>In October, 1779, he embarked from Boston for Europe, and after
a long and tedious passage, he arrived at Paris in February following.
The British ministry were not yet sufficiently humbled to do right,
and Mr. Adams had too much sagacity to be ensnared, and too much
moral courage to consent to any thing wrong. Anxious to benefit his
country, on hearing that Mr. Laurens, the American commissioner to
Holland, had been captured, he immediately repaired to that kingdom,
and in August received a commission from Congress to negotiate a
loan and to conclude a treaty of amity and commerce with the States
General of Holland, with instructions to accede to any treaty of neutral
rights that might arise from regulations to be made by a congress
of the European states, then in contemplation. In a few months he
was completely overwhelmed with diplomatic powers. He was minister
plenipotentiary to Great Britain—to the States General—to the
prince of Orange—to all the European states for pledging the faith of
the United States to the armed neutrality, with letters of credit to the
Russian, Swedish and Danish envoys in Holland, and a commissioner
to negotiate a loan of ten millions of dollars for the support of the
home department and foreign embassies. The duties thus devolving
upon him, all of which he discharged with approbation, will give the
reader some idea of the gigantic mental powers of John Adams. He
had the same kind of intrigue to encounter as that alluded to in the
biography of Franklin, which he met at the threshold and crushed whilst
in embryo.</p>

<p>In July, 1781, he received a summons from the court of France to
repair immediately to Versailles to deliberate upon a plan of peace
with England. On his arrival he had occasion for the exercise of that
moral courage that sustained him in every dilemma. The terms
offered did not fully recognise the rights of the United States as an
independent sovereign nation—peace was anxiously desired and ardently
urged by the Duke de Vergennes, who stood at the head of
the French cabinet—Mr. Adams desired it too, but only upon honourable
and dignified terms. The duke, who had uniformly showed
a disposition to make the United States at least <em>feel</em> deeply a dependence
upon France, undertook to dictate to Mr. Adams, and placed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
him in the position of a subordinate agent. In this project he was
greatly mistaken. Mr. Adams recognised no dictator but the Continental
Congress and his own keen and penetrating judgment. So
chagrined was the French duke at the independence of the American
minister, that he wrote to the chevalier de la Luzerne, then minister
from France in America, to lay a formal complaint against Mr. Adams
before Congress. This he did in a very ingenious manner, but without
success. As a matter of deference to their new and important
ally, the members of Congress very partially modified the instructions
to their minister, but did not place him under the control of the duke
as requested. They knew the spirit of John Adams would never compromise
the dignity of the American name, and they reposed entire
confidence in his ability to perceive the right, and in his moral courage
to pursue it. It became evident that the motives of the French court
in giving assistance to the United States were based entirely on self.
Her objects were to humble her inveterate foe, and when that was accomplished,
to secure her own aggrandizement and that of Spain at
the expense of America. I speak of the <em>court</em> of France, and not of
the good Lafayette and French patriots like him.</p>

<p>Finding that his presence could be of no service at Versailles, Mr.
Adams returned to Amsterdam. Soon after this, so powerfully did
the French minister operate upon Congress, taking the advantage of
the reverses of the American arms, that he induced that body to add
to the commission of Mr. Adams, Dr. Franklin, Messrs. Jefferson,
Jay and Laurens, with the humiliating direction, “that they should
govern themselves by the advice and opinion of the ministers of the
king of France.” The duke de Vergennes now exulted in his power,
having been made by Congress virtually the sovereign minister of the
United States to Great Britain. But his exultation was delusive.
Nothing could bend Mr. Adams or Franklin, and the other commissioners
became convinced of the propriety of the bold stand assumed.
Mr. Adams wrote to Congress and exposed the plans of the duke and
his coadjutors, and was the bold medium of communication that opened
the eyes of its members to see and permit the commissioner to maintain
their true dignity, which enabled them to finally obtain an honourable
peace. He also succeeded, after surmounting many Alpine
barriers, in negotiating a loan in Holland of eight millions of guilders,
in September, 1782. The benefits of this loan were two-fold—it
enabled the United States to prosecute the war with more vigour, and
had a direct influence upon England, inducing her to make proposals
of peace soon after this was known to lord Shelburne, then at the head
of the British administration, which secured to the United States the
great privileges insisted on by Mr. Adams. A provisional treaty was
signed at Paris on the thirtieth of November, 1782, and a definitive
treaty was signed on the third of September, 1783. This step was
taken without consulting the duke de Vergennes, and completely
thwarted his golden schemes of finesse. He addressed a letter of reproach
to the American commissioners, because they dared to proceed
without his approbation, which they did not condescend to answer.
The three grand points in the plan of the court of France were—in securing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
to themselves the trade and fisheries of the Unites States, and
for Spain—the sole right of navigating the Mississippi river.</p>

<p>After the important work of concluding peace with England was
accomplished, Mr. Adams returned to Holland, where he remained a
part of the year 1784, when he returned to France and assumed the
duties of a commission, at the head of which he was placed, having Dr.
Franklin and Mr. Jefferson associated with him, forming a trio of combined,
various and exalted talent, never surpassed if ever equalled.
They were empowered to negotiate commercial treaties with all foreign
nations that desired such an arrangement with the United States.</p>

<p>In 1785, Mr. Adams was appointed the first minister to Great Britain
after the acknowledgement of the independence of the United
States by that kingdom. He was received with marked attention and
courtesy, so far as courtly etiquette and ceremony were concerned, but
found the ministry morose and bitter in their feelings towards the new
republic. They were unwilling to enter into a commercial treaty,
and seemed to treat the peace as a mere truce between the two nations.
Mr. Adams performed the delicate duties of his mission with great
sagacity and wisdom, and patiently removed subsisting difficulties
between the two countries. Nor did he remain passive as to the internal
affairs of his country at home. To win independence he considered
one thing, to preserve it, was a different and more difficult matter.
The theories of a republican form of government that had been
published by Thurgot<a id="FNanchor_H" href="#Footnote_H" class="fnanchor">H</a> and others, and freely circulated in America,
he considered wild and visionary, as the transient existence of the
French republic subsequently proved. To strip these delusive theories
of their sophistry, Mr. Adams published a learned and able disquisition
on republican constitutions, which operated as a polar light
to his own countrymen and had a powerful influence in correcting error
and allaying prejudices in England against the government of the
United States. His “Defence of the Constitutions” also placed him
on a lofty eminence in view of the literati of Europe.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_H" href="#FNanchor_H" class="fnanchor">H</a> Thurgot said of Franklin—“He first snatched the thunderbolt from Jove, and
then the sceptre from kings.”</p></div>

<p>In 1788, he obtained permission to return home, and in the autumn
of the same year was elected the first vice-president of the United
States under the federal constitution, the duties of which station he
performed with dignity and great ability. He was a confidential counsellor
of Washington, who consulted him on all important questions.
He was re-elected in 1792, with but little opposition; and in 1796, he
was elected president of the republic, to establish which he had perilled
life, fortune and honour. At this time party spirit had commenced its
career of venality and his election was warmly contested. His opponent,
Mr. Jefferson, received sixty-eight votes and Mr. Adams seventy-one.
During all the effervescence of party feeling, which arrayed
father against son and cut asunder the long cherished ties of friendship
between thousands, these two great men remained personal friends,
showing at once the magnanimity of their minds and the folly of low
minded foaming partizans. It was then that the American press first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
descended from its lofty and legitimate eminence and planted it before
unsullied feet in the obloquious quagmire of party spirit. Since
that time partisan presses have been sinking deeper and deeper, until
some of them, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro et con.</i>, have become so deeply planted in the filth
and scum of personal abuse and political slander, that, to use a simile,
Archimedes, with the mighty powers of his lever, could not raise them
to their pristine elevation in half a century. So far were matters carried
by his political friends against the public measures of Mr. Adams
in 1800, that Mr. Jefferson was compelled, from a sense of duty, to
rebuke the slanders that were uttered, in the following emphatic language,
which becomes more forcible from the fact that his own private
character had been shamefully attacked by those who supported his
political opponent.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, you do not know that man—there is not upon earth a
more perfectly honest man than John Adams. Concealment is no
part of his character—of that, he is utterly incapable. It is not
in his nature to meditate any thing that he would not publish to
the world. The measures of the general government are a fair subject
for difference of opinion—but do not found your opinions on the
notion that there is the smallest spice of dishonesty, moral or political,
in the character of John Adams, for I know him well, and I repeat—that
a man more perfectly honest never issued from the hands of his Creator.”</p>

<p>Mr. Adams proceeded to the conscientious and independent discharge
of his presidential duties, prompted by the best motives for the
glory of his country. His administration, however, became unpopular,
and at the expiration of his term the democratic party triumphed,
and he retired to Quincy, to once more enjoy the long lost comforts of
retirement. Much has been written upon the causes that produced
the political overthrow of Mr. Adams. To my mind the solution is
brief and plain. His cabinet was not of his own choosing—he was too
independent to bend to party management—he opposed the humiliating
demands of the then self-styled democratic France—he advocated,
most earnestly, the augmentation of the navy of the United States, and
recommended the law for suppressing the venality of the press. In
the two first points he was impolitic as the head of a <em>party</em>—in the
two next, he did what all now acknowledge to be right—and in the
last, he took the wrong method to correct one of the most alarming
evils of that day—an evil that still hangs over our country like an
incubus. The three last were the strong points seized upon by partisans,
and were rendered extremely unpopular, and enabled his opponents
to defeat his re-election. He retired with a good grace, and remained
the personal friend of his rival until the day of his death. He
supported the policy of Mr. Jefferson towards England, and approved
of the declaration of war in 1812. In writing to a friend, in
July of that year, he remarked:</p>

<p>“To your allusion to the war, I have nothing to say—but that it is
with surprise that I hear it pronounced, not only in the newspapers,
but by persons in authority, ecclesiastical and civil, and political and
military—that the declaration of it was altogether unexpected * * *<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
How it is possible that a rational, a social or a moral creature can say
the war is unjust, is to me utterly incomprehensible. How it can
be said to be unnecessary, is very mysterious. I have thought it necessary
for five or six years. How it can be said to be unexpected, is
another wonder. I have expected it more than five-and-twenty years,
and have great reason to be thankful that it has been postponed so
long.”</p>

<p>He attributed the opposition of the eastern states to the war to the
impolicy of the government in not cherishing the navy, and compared
them to Achilles, who, in consequence of his being deprived of Briseis,
withdrew from the Grecian confederacy. The augmentation of
the navy was the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ne plus ultra</i> of his national policy, and had his
views upon this point been carried out by our government, our
nation would now have been mistress of the seas, instead of having
scarcely armed vessels enough to protect the expanding commerce of
our enterprising merchants—a fact that has become a by-word among
other nations, and has often crimsoned the cheeks of liberal minded
Americans.</p>

<p>Soon after his retirement he was offered the gubernatorial chair of
his native state, but declined the honour on account of his advanced
age—but continued to take a deep interest in the welfare of his
country, and wrote many essays and letters in favour of liberal principles
and American rights. After the retirement of Mr. Jefferson, a
most happy and interesting correspondence was continued between
these two great apostles of liberty. In 1815, Mr. Adams had the
gratifying pleasure of seeing his son at the head of the diplomatic commission
to conclude a second treaty with Great Britain, which carried
his mind back, with all the enthusiastic force of an old man’s memory,
to the scenes of 1782–3, when he had performed and executed a
similar mission. In 1817, he was placed at the head of the list of presidential
electors, and three years after was elected president of the
convention that revised the constitution he had written forty years
previous. The compliment was duly appreciated by him, but his
infirmities did not permit him to preside over the deliberations of that
body, although he imparted his counsels and aided greatly in the revision.
This was the last public act of this great man—the curtain of
the political drama then closed upon him for ever. Two years previous
the partner of his bosom had gone to her final rest, which was an
affliction most keenly felt by him. For more than half a century she
had shared with him the pains and pleasures of their eventful career,
and had always met the events of life with christian fortitude. Surrounded
by friends who delighted to honour him, his country prosperous
and happy, enjoying the full fruition of divine grace, which had
produced the fruits of unsophisticated piety through a long life, political
animosities buried in oblivion, his now frail bark glided smoothly
down the stream of time until the fiftieth anniversary of independence
dawned upon his beloved country. On the morning of the fourth of
July, 1826, an unexpected debility seized him, and he was unable to
leave his bed, but no one imagined he was standing on the last inch of
his time. He was asked for a sentiment, to be given for him at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
celebration on that day—“<span class="smcap smaller">INDEPENDENCE FOR EVER</span>,” burst from his
dying lips, which were the last words that he ever uttered, with a
loud and animated voice. About four o’clock in the afternoon he expired—without
an apparent pain, a groan, a murmur or a sigh, with a
full assurance of a happy reception in that brighter world, where sin
and sorrow never cross the peaceful path of the angelic throng. On
the same day, and but a few hours previous, the immortal spirit of the
illustrious Jefferson had left its prison of clay, thrown off its mortal
coil, and perhaps took its kindred in its flight, and they together
“ascended in essence to an ecstatic meeting with the friends they
had loved and lost, and whom they should still love and never lose,”
there to enjoy, through the rolling ages of eternity, the blissful scenes
of angelic purity—the smiles and favours of their Saviour and their
God.</p>

<p>This unparalleled combination of extraordinary circumstances produced
a deep and unusual sensation in the United States and in Europe.
The simultaneous departure of two of the noblest spirits that
ever graced the great theatre of human life, illuminating the world
around them with freedom—whose actions had resounded through the
universe—whose mighty deeds had been and will continue to be a
theme of wonder and admiration to the end of time—was an incident
that seemed designed by the great Jehovah, to impress their precepts,
their examples and their names upon the minds of men with all the
force of god-like divinity.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams was a plain man; low in stature, not graceful in his
movements, and was sometimes abrupt and repulsive. His manners
were rather austere and unbending in public, but in the social circle,
with his relatives and friends, he was familiar, pleasing and entertaining.
He was not partial to ceremonious etiquette, and was averse to
pedantry. Plain strong common sense he practised and admired. He
spoke his sentiments freely, and could never have been transformed
into a <em>technical</em> politican, even had he enjoyed the magic advantages
of modern schools. His open frankness was proverbial, and he often
alluded to it as one of his failings. When once in Stewart’s room of
paintings, he fixed his eyes upon the portrait of Washington, and then
upon his own, and observing the compressed mouth of the former and
the open lips of the latter, facetiously remarked as he pointed to it—“Ah!
that fellow never could keep his mouth shut.” This circumstance
alone did much to enhance his unpopularity as a party politician.</p>

<p>In the brilliant career of this great and good man the reader must
discover a higher and holier eulogy than language can express. For
more than fifty years he served his country ably and faithfully in a
public capacity, and continued to impart his counsels until the curtain
of death shut him from the world. In all the relations of private
life he stood upon a lofty eminence—beyond the reach of slander.
The escutcheon of his social name was too pure for the approach of
the foulest of all pestiferous atmospheres—that of party spirit. And
now, as his ashes rest in the peaceful grave, that hydra monster dare
not impute to his actions in life a spark of political dishonesty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
or impurity of motive, however much he differed from other great
men in his views, lest the voice of Jefferson should proclaim to them
from the tomb—<span class="smcap">An honester man than John Adams never issued
from the hands of the Creator</span>.</p>

<hr />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_58">GEORGE WASHINGTON.</h2>
</div>

<p>This revered name stands associated with every amiable and noble
quality to which mortal man can attain on this dim revolving ball of
human action. A sacred halo encircles it, that renders it dear to
every philanthropist and respected by the whole civilized world. I
am aware that his merits cannot be enhanced by eulogy, nor could
detraction ever tarnish the glory of his fame. I am aware that the
whole magazine of language has been exhausted in his praise. I am
aware that talents of the highest order, hearts of the warmest devotion,
imaginations of the happiest conception, united with the most
refined and thrilling eloquence, have portrayed, in bold and glowing
colours, the fair fame of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>. To delineate fully and clearly
the virtues of this great and good man, would require an angel’s pen
dipped in etherial fire, and an angel’s hand to guide it. His life cannot
be too often reviewed; his examples cannot be too closely imitated.
Like some magnificent scenes of nature, his history is</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Ever charming, ever new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prospect never tires the view.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The lustre of his virtues was of that celestial character, that, like the
luminary of day, it is seen and felt, but cannot be fully described. His
picture is one on which we may gaze with increased delight, and discover
new beauties to the last. His memory should be rehearsed by
every print in our land; every new press and fount of type should
spread, in glowing capitals, the name of the beloved, the illustrious
WASHINGTON. The aged sire should impress it on the hearts of the
rising generation; the mother should teach it to her lisping babe; the
preceptor should point his pupils to this polar star of virtue, goodness
and magnanimity; and the friends of union, liberty and order, should
read often, carefully and attentively, the biography of the father of
our country. These are deemed reasons sufficiently strong to prompt
this humble effort to delineate the interesting career of the man who
was first in peace—terrible in war—the friend of humanity—the <span class="smcap">Hero
of American Independence</span>—and the founder of our country’s glory.
To me, the subject possesses a peculiar zest, fraught with pleasure
and delight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Washington</span> was born in the county of Fairfax, Virginia,
on the 22nd of February, 1732. He lost his father at an early age,
and to the wisdom of his mother he declared himself indebted for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
correct formation of his youthful mind. Matrons of America, if the
mother of Washington moulded <em>his</em> mind with such beauty and greatness,
how much may <em>you</em> do to perpetuate, through your sons, the
prosperity and happiness of your favoured country! Train their
youthful minds in wisdom’s ways; guide them in the paths of virtue
and patriotism; teach them to love their country and its liberty; and
to prize, dearer than life, the sacred boon of freedom that was nobly
won and sacredly transmitted by the sages and patriots of ’76.</p>

<p>Washington, during his childhood and youth, exhibited a strong
and enquiring mind. His habits were those of industry, perseverance
and stability. He was assiduous in his studies and enriched his memory
with solid and useful knowledge. He possessed a large share of
merit and modesty, which gained for him the love and esteem of all
who had the pleasure of his acquaintance. He was frank, open,
generous, humane and honest. Nothing could induce him to utter a
falsehood, practice deceit, or disobey his fond mother. He soared above
the vain and trifling amusements that so often divert youth from wisdom’s
ways. He was designed to be a star of the first magnitude on
the great theatre of action; he studied well his part before he entered
upon the stage, and when the curtain rose, he was prepared for his
audience, acquitted himself nobly, and retired amidst the plaudits and
cheers of astonished and admiring millions.</p>

<p>His talents and merit attracted the attention of Governor Dinwiddie,
who then presided over Virginia, the frontiers of which were greatly
annoyed by the French and Indians. It was deemed necessary to send
a messenger to them, demanding the reasons for their unprovoked hostility,
and, if possible, to induce them to evacuate their forts, smoke
the pipe of peace and disperse. Young Washington, then only twenty-one
years of age, was selected to perform this important mission,
which was fraught with dangers on every side. His path lay through
a dense wilderness for four hundred miles, inhabited by roving Indians
seeking for prey. He undertook the hazardous enterprise and
arrived at his place of destination in safety. Whilst the French commandant
was writing an answer to Governor Dinwiddie, Washington,
unobserved, took the dimensions of the fort and returned unmolested.
It was soon found necessary to raise a regiment of troops to arrest
the bloody career of the savages on the frontiers. Washington was
placed in command over them with the commission of colonel, and
marched towards the Great Meadows in April, 1754. On his way he
surprised and captured a body of the enemy. On his arrival at the
Great Meadows he erected a small stockade fort, very appropriately
naming it Fort Necessity. Here he was reinforced, swelling his little
army to four hundred men. He then made preparations to attack
Fort Du Quesne (now Pittsburgh,) but soon learned that the enemy
was advancing upon him to the number of 1500 men, commanded by
M. de Villiers. The attack was soon commenced with great fury,
and continued for several hours, when the French commander offered
terms of capitulation and was glad to permit the young champion to
march away unmolested. This brilliant and bold adventure placed
the talents of Washington high on the scale of eminence, as a bold,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
skilful and prudent officer. It occurred on the 4th of July, a happy
prelude to the glorious 4th of ’76, the grand birthday of American
Independence.</p>

<p>The following year another expedition was sent against Fort Du
Quesne of about two thousand troops, under the command of the unfortunate
General Braddock, who had more courage than prudence,
more self-conceit than wisdom. He spurned the advice of the “beardless
boy,” and rushed into a snare, where he and nearly half of his
army met the cold embrace of death. The deliberate courage and
superior skill of Washington, by a judicious retreat, saved the remainder
from the bloody tomahawk and scalping-knife. He arrived
with them safe at Fort Cumberland. By his rashness, Braddock led
his men into an ambuscade of about five hundred French and Indians,
who were secreted in three deep ravines forming a triangle, secure
from danger unless charged, where he remained with them until he
had five horses shot under him, nearly half of his men cut down, himself
mortally wounded, and not an enemy to be seen. One hundred
men headed by Washington, with fixed bayonets, would have dispersed
them in ten minutes.</p>

<p>Washington, unwilling to witness again such waste of human life,
resigned his military command and retired to private life. But his
sterling talents were not suffered to remain long inactive. He was
elected to the legislature from Frederick, and subsequently from Fairfax,
and was highly respected as a wise, discerning legislator, exhibiting
a mind imbued with philanthropy and liberal principles, guided
by a clear judgment and a sound discretion, adorned by a retiring
modesty, too rare in men of talent.</p>

<p>From this field of action, Washington entered one of greater magnitude
and importance, big with events, involving consequences of
the deepest interest to himself, to his country, and to the world.
After serving the mother country in the French war with blood and
treasure, after submitting to taxation, oppression, and insult for years,
the colonists resolved to burst the chains of slavery, throw off the
shackles of tyranny, and assume their native dignity. Every source
of redress had been exhausted; every avenue of conciliation had been
explored; more than reason could demand had been offered; all that
was clearly <em>right</em>, and much that was clearly <em>wrong</em>, the pilgrims had
submitted to, and still their ungracious, their unfeeling, their blinded
mother, cried give—give—give. They had not dreamed of independence;
they had only demanded sheer justice; this being denied, they
resorted to the last, the only alternative. Instead of submitting to
taxation, without representation—instead of yielding obedience to the
pernicious stamp act, they stamped their names with unfading glory,
their country with lasting fame. In the autumn of 1774, the first
great Congress of the American nation assembled at Philadelphia, of
which Washington was a member. The solemnities of that thrilling
scene have been repeatedly alluded to as of the most imposing character.
No one felt them more deeply than the father of our country.
When the proceedings were opened by prayer, Washington alone was
upon his knees. His mind, on all occasions, seems to have reached to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
heaven, his soul seemed to dwell in the bosom of his God. Devoted,
unsophisticated and humble piety marked his whole life—a piety sincere
in its motives and consistent in all its exhibitions. But Washington
was not to remain in the hall of the Continental Congress. A
mighty work was in store for him. On the memorable 19th of April,
1775, on the heights of Lexington, American blood was spilt by order
of Major Pitcairn. Justice looked at the purple current as it flowed,
and sighed; mercy carried the sad news to the etherial skies; the eagle
of liberty caught the mournful sound, descended in a stream of liquid
fire, planted the torch of freedom in the serum of the bleeding patriots
and bid eternal defiance to the British lion.</p>

<p>The effect was electrical. The alarm spread with the rapidity of
lightning. It was sounded from church-bells and signal-guns; echo carried
it from hills to dales, from sire to son. Vengeance was roused
from its lair; the hardy yeomanry left their ploughs in the furrow;
the merchant forsook his counting-house; the professional man his
office; the minister his pulpit; and with powder-horn and slug,
shouldered their rusty muskets, hastened to the scene of action determined
to avenge their injured rights, defend their bleeding country,
or perish in the attempt. The implements of husbandry were exchanged
for those of war; the mechanic shop, the bar, the desk and
the forum, were exchanged for the dangers and fatigues of the army.
A band of veterans arose, with “hearts of oak and nerves of steel,”
headed by that bright luminary the illustrious <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, who stood
forth the champions of <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>, the advocates of <span class="smcap">Freedom</span>; resolved
upon emancipation or death; pledging their lives, their fortunes, and
their sacred honours in defence of their common country; looking to
Heaven for strength, guidance and support. Illustrious heroes! disinterested
patriots! yours exceeded all Greek, all Roman fame.</p>

<p>In June following, Washington was appointed by the unanimous
voice of the Continental Congress commander-in-chief of the American
armies. This appointment he accepted with diffidence and reluctance,
feeling that it involved responsibilities, consequences and results
too mighty for him to assume, too vast for him to encounter.</p>

<p>He did not view it as the field of glory, of conquest, of ambition,
or of fame. He did not thirst for human blood or exult in the profession
of arms. Love of country, of liberty, of human rights, of
liberal principles, and the oppressive chains of tyranny, prompted him
to action.</p>

<p>Before his arrival at Cambridge, to enter upon the important duties
of his command, the fortress of Crown Point and Ticonderoga had
fallen into the hands of the colonists.</p>

<p>The sanguinary battle of Bunker Hill had been fought, which convinced
the British that men contending for their just rights, their
dearest interests, their bosoms fired with indignation and patriotism,
could not be made to yield to the glittering arms of a haughty monarch
without a bold and daring effort to maintain that liberty which
they had received at their birth from the hands of their Creator.</p>

<p>War now assumed a serious aspect, the bloody toils of the revolution
commenced. England poured in her legions by thousands, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
to cap the climax of the terrific scene, called to her aid the blood-thirsty
Indian with his tomahawk and scalping-knife. The welkin
rang with the savage war-whoop and the expiring groans of mothers
and babes. The contest seemed to be that of an infant with a giant, a
lamb with a lion. The dark clouds blackened as they rose, charged
with the fury of demons and the lightning of revenge.</p>

<p>Washington viewed their fiery aspect with calm serenity, heard
their portentous roar without a tremor. With a soul reaching to
heaven, he met the awful crisis with firmness and wisdom before unknown;
his gigantic mind soared above the highest pinnacle difficulty
could rear; his course was onward towards the goal of <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>; beneath
his conquering arm monarchy trembled, tottered and fell.</p>

<p>His whole energy was now directed to the organization of the army
and a preparation for future action. An important expedition was
planned against Canada, which was attended with great hardship,
boldness and perseverance. It was entrusted to Generals Montgomery
and Schuyler, who were subsequently followed by Arnold. It
was crowned with success, until an unfortunate attack was made
upon Quebec, where the brave Montgomery fell with many other
valuable officers and soldiers. The ensuing spring the American army
evacuated Canada. The royal governors in some of the colonies, by
the aid of the king’s troops, still maintained the authority of the
crown, but they were soon compelled to flee on board of the British
ships of war, where they issued their proclamations with about as
much effect as the puffing of a porpoise.</p>

<p>Early in March, 1776, Washington appeared before Boston, where
lord Howe had concentrated his army, and took a position that induced
the English general to evacuate the town on the 17th of the same
month. In July, the fort on Sullivan’s Island was attacked by General
Clinton and Sir Peter Parker, and after an action of ten hours,
Sir Peter was compelled to retire with his silk breeches disfigured by
the rudeness of a cannon ball, his ships badly torn to pieces by the
rebel artillery, and two hundred of his men killed and wounded.
The fort was defended by Colonel Moultrie with about five hundred
men, with twenty-six nine and eighteen pounders. Sir Peter had two
fifty gun ships, four frigates and several small vessels, with three
thousand veteran troops. There was so much elasticity in the southern
climate on this occasion, that the royalists did not venture there
again for nearly two years.</p>

<p>On the 7th of June, Richard Henry Lee, a member from Virginia,
made a motion in Congress to break off all allegiance with the mother
country, and assume the rightful dignity of a free and independent
nation. This resulted in the appointment of Thomas Jefferson, John
Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman and Philip Livingston,
a committee to draft a declaration of independence; and, on the 4th of
July, they arose in all the majesty of greatness, and in view of an admiring
heaven and an astonished world, published that master-piece
of composition which gave us national birth, absolved us from kingly
power, planted the tree of liberty deep in our soil, and showed to anxious
and gazing millions, that a nation could be born in a day and live.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
Language can never express, and none but those who witnessed the
thrilling scene can fully conceive with what enthusiastic joy this declaration
was received by the people. The bells sounded a requiem
and funeral knell for monarchy; illuminations and roaring artillery
quickly conveyed the glad news from the central arch of the union to
its remotest bounds; the blazing torch of liberty rose, like a pillar of
fire, to guide the patriots in their onward march; on the wings of
thanksgiving and praise the happy tidings ascended to the throne of
heaven, received the sanction of Jehovah’s high authority, and were
recorded by the hand of justice, with an angel’s pen, in the book of
everlasting fame. Kindred hearts mingled in joy and gratitude, and
every <span class="smcap smaller">FREEMAN</span> shouted a hearty response—a loud AMEN.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of July, Admiral and General Howe landed near the
narrows, nine miles below the city of New York, with twenty-four
thousand men. They sent an insulting communication to Washington,
which he very properly refused to receive. That part of the
American army stationed at Brooklyn, under the command of General
Sullivan, was attacked and defeated with great loss, on the 27th
of August; and Generals Sullivan, Sterling and Woodhull were
taken prisoners. Two days after, Washington planned and effected
a retreat, and landed the troops from Long Island safely in New
York, before the movement was discovered by the enemy. Chagrined
and mortified at the loss of their prey, the British prepared to
attack the city, which induced the Americans to evacuate it and retire
to White Plains. Here they were attacked on the 28th of September;
the British were repulsed, a considerable loss was sustained
on both sides, neither party gaining a decided advantage. The disasters
of the patriots multiplied rapidly; fort Washington and fort
Lee fell into the hands of the English, and the American army was
flying before a barbarous and conquering foe.</p>

<p>Washington crossed the Hudson, and retreated through New Jersey
into Pennsylvania, with Lord Cornwallis pressing on his rear. His
army was now reduced to three thousand men, who were destitute of
almost every comfort of life; they could be tracked by blood from
their naked feet on the frozen ground; disaster had chilled the zeal
of many leading men who at first espoused the cause of liberty; a
cloud of fiery indignation hung over the bleeding colonies, ready to
devour them. But in the archives of heaven their <span class="smcap smaller">FREEDOM</span> was recorded;
guardian angels directed their destiny; the bold career of
the lion was arrested; this Spartan band was crowned with victory,
and the red coats, in their turn, beat a retreat.</p>

<p>On the night of the 25th of December, Washington recrossed the
Delaware amidst the floating ice, surprised and took one thousand
of the enemy prisoners at Trenton, pushed on to Princeton, killed
sixty more, took three hundred prisoners, and spread consternation
in the ranks of the British army. These successes removed much of
the gloom and despondency that hung over the cause. Washington
retired to Morristown for the winter; the English occupied Brunswick.
In the spring of 1777, the army of Washington amounted to
about seven thousand men. No action occurred between the main<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
armies until in August, when the British landed in Maryland with
the intention of capturing Philadelphia.</p>

<p>On the 11th of September the two armies met at Brandywine; a
desperate battle ensued, and partial victory attended the English
army. On the approach of the enemy Philadelphia was abandoned
and Congress retired to Lancaster. Another severe battle was fought
at Germantown on the 4th of October, which proved disastrous to
Washington, owing to a thick fog, by which his troops became separated
and thrown into confusion. These keen misfortunes were much
alleviated by the capture of the whole British army in the north under
Burgoyne, by General Gates, on the 17th of October. The surrender
of Burgoyne had a happy effect at home and abroad. France, on the
reception of this news, recognised the independence of the United
States, entered into a treaty of alliance, and furnished important
aid in advancing the glorious cause, and sent many of her bravest
sons to the rescue.</p>

<p>The treaty of alliance between the United States and France, and
the loss of their northern army, induced the English to evacuate
Philadelphia in the spring of 1778, and retreat to New York. From
there they made frequent descents upon various places, burning and
destroying property, murdering the inhabitants, and spreading desolation
wherever they went.</p>

<p>An expedition was sent to Georgia which proved successful, and
the south now became the principal theatre of action. Many feats of
bravery were performed, but no decisive battle occurred between the
main armies. The same mode of warfare characterized the campaign
of 1779, the British seeming to aim more at predatory excursions
than pitched battles, which they performed with a savage barbarity,
disgraceful to themselves and heart-rending to humanity.</p>

<p>The exertions of Washington were almost paralyzed for the want
of men and money; the French Admiral, D’Estaing, was unfortunate
in all his movements, and the British lion was prowling through the
land in all the majesty of cruelty. The anchor of hope could scarcely
keep the shattered bark of liberty to its moorings; the cable of exertion
lost thread after thread, until a small band of sages and heroes,
who formed the nucleus, were left to contend with the fury of the
storm that rolled its fiery and foaming surges over them.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1780 opened favourably to the royal arms, but
more exertion was used on the part of the Americans. General
Sumpter gave the British much trouble in the south, and a considerable
force from the north was on its march to avenge the blood of
slaughtered victims. The cruelties of the enemy had re-illumined
the cause of freedom, and the people once more rallied around her
sacred banner, determined on death or victory.</p>

<p>The southern army was now put under the command of General
Gates, the hero of Saratoga—fresh aid arrived from France and the
conflict was renewed with fury and desperation. On the 18th of
August the two armies met near Camden, S.&nbsp;C.,—a decided advantage
was gained by Lord Cornwallis. But defeat and misfortune
no longer disheartened the friends of liberty. In the midst of adversity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
they rose like a phœnix from ashes, and hurled, with the fury of
Mars, the thunderbolts of vengeance amongst their enemies.</p>

<p>The battle of the Cowpens, on the 17th of January, 1781, shed new
lustre on the American arms. General Morgan there met the high-toned
Colonel Tarleton, killed rising of one hundred men, wounded
two hundred, took five hundred prisoners, two pieces of cannon, twelve
standards, eight hundred muskets, thirty-five baggage wagons, one
hundred dragoon horses, with a loss of only twelve killed and sixty
wounded. His force amounted to only five hundred militia and a
few regulars—that of Tarleton to over one thousand regulars, the
flower of the British army.</p>

<p>Morgan now effected a junction with General Green, who had succeeded
General Gates, and on the 8th of March they met the forces
of Lord Cornwallis at Guilford court-house, where an obstinate battle
was fought and the Americans compelled to leave the field. On the
9th of April General Green again put his troops in motion—on the
25th the two armies once more measured arms,—Green was compelled
to retreat—not before a pursuing foe, but towards the British garrison
Ninety-Six, which he reached and besieged on the 22nd of May, and
gave it a hearty salute; but on the approach of Lord Rawdon with
a large force, he modestly retired to the Santee hills to spend the hot
and sickly season. In the meantime the English army encamped at
Eutaw Springs, where Green renewed the attack on the 8th of September,
and after a hard fought action, in which neither gained a decided
victory, the enemy retired to Charleston, with a loss in killed,
wounded and prisoners, of eleven hundred men. The Americans lost
five hundred and fifty-five.</p>

<p>Although General Green had not gained any decided victory, he
had gained many advantages and greatly weakened the enemy. Generals
Lee and Wayne had been more successful, and the British
were annoyed and harassed in every quarter—volunteers flocked
around their beloved Washington, and the tide of war turned in his
favour.</p>

<p>The patriotic Lafayette was now in the field. Morgan, Wayne,
Greene and Lee were at their posts. Count de Grasse was co-operating
with his fleet; and, in their turn, the English lords, admirals
and generals, found themselves surrounded with impending danger.
An awful crisis awaited them—retribution stared them in the face—their
deeds of blood haunted their guilty souls, and consternation
seized their troubled minds. Lord Cornwallis hastened to concentrate
his forces at Yorktown, which he fortified in the best possible manner.</p>

<p>On the 6th of October the combined forces of Washington and Rochambeau
commenced a siege upon this place, which surrendered on
the 19th of the same month. The grand Rubicon was now passed, the
colonies were free—the work was finished. This was the dying
struggle of British monarchy in America. The last expiring hope of
conquering the colonies now fled for ever. Heaven had decreed they
should be free—that decree was now consummated. The eagle of
liberty, like Jordan’s dove, descended—pronounced a benediction
upon the conquering heroes—snatched the laurels from Britain’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
brow and placed them triumphantly upon the <span class="smcap">champions of American
Independence</span>. To the friends of <span class="smcap">Freedom</span> the scene was grand and
joyful—to the enemies of <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>, it was painful and humiliating.</p>

<p>The result of this victory was hailed with joy, and placed Washington
on the lofty summit of immortal fame—gave freedom to his bleeding
country—sealed the foundations of our republic, now towering to
the skies—prepared an asylum for the oppressed, and planted deep
in Columbia’s soil the long nursed tree of <span class="smcap smaller">LIBERTY</span>.</p>

<p>On the 30th of September, 1783, a definitive treaty was signed at
Paris by Mr. Fitzherbert and Mr. Oswald, on the part of Great Britain,
and by John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay and Henry
Laurens, on the part of the United States.</p>

<p>On the second of November, Washington issued his farewell orders
to his army, in terms of affectionate eloquence and parental solicitude.
On the 3d, the troops were disbanded by Congress, and, with mingling
tears of joy and gratitude, they once more repaired to their homes to
meet the warm embrace of friends, and reap the fruit of their toils and
fatigues—no longer embittered by the iron scourge of despotism. On
the 23d of December, Washington appeared in the hall of Congress
and resigned his commission. This last act was one of grandeur and
thrilling interest. The past, the present and the future, were all in
the mind of this great and good man, as he invoked the blessings of
Heaven to descend and guide the destinies of his beloved, his emancipated
country. Every heart beat quicker and higher—his commission
was laid upon the table—a burst of applause rent the air, a flood
of tears closed the scene.</p>

<p>The people of the United States, no longer under the paternal care of
their old mother, were now left to try the experiment of self-government.
Difficulties arose from local jealousies and interests—a debt of forty
millions of dollars had been contracted—government paper became
greatly depreciated—the public credit could not be sustained, and the
liberty that the patriots had fought and bled to obtain, seemed doomed
to a premature dissolution and to be lost in the whirlpool of anarchy and
confusion. In view of these accumulating difficulties, commissioners
from every state, except Rhode Island, convened at Philadelphia, for
the purpose of devising means to preserve and perfect that freedom
which had cost millions of treasure and fountains of noble blood.
Washington was unanimously elected president of this august body.
After long deliberation, the labours of the delegates resulted in the
production of the federal constitution, one of the brightest specimens
of legislation on record. It is the polar star of freedom, the great
palladium of our liberty, the golden chain that connects our union, the
grand rallying point of republicans, a shield against innovation and
corruption, a terror to tyrants, a shining light to patriots, and stamps
with immortal and lasting fame the names of its illustrious authors.</p>

<p>This was reported to Congress on the 17th of September, received
their warm approbation, and was immediately sent to the several
states for their consideration, all of which gave it their sanction, except
North Carolina and Rhode Island—the former of which acceded
to it in 1789, the latter in 1790. A degree of confidence was then
restored, and from that time down to the present our nation has rolled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
on in the full tide of successful experiment, and enjoyed an increasing
and towering prosperity without a parallel in the annals of history.
The star-spangled banner waves on every sea, and is respected by
every nation in the civilized world: our improvements at home have
marched in advance of the boldest views of the most visionary projector,
the fondest anticipations of their most ardent friends.</p>

<p>By the unanimous voice of a free and grateful people, Washington
was elected the first president of the new republic, and, with the same
modest diffidence that had marked his whole career, he took the oath
of office on the 30th of April, 1789, in the city of New York, in the
presence of the first Congress under the new constitution, and in the
presence of a crowded assembly, who deeply felt and strongly expressed
their love and gratitude to him. He then entered upon the
important duties that devolved upon him.</p>

<p>A revenue was to be raised, the judiciary system to be organized,
its officers to be appointed, a cabinet to be formed and every department
of government to be established on a basis at once firm, impartial,
just and humane. In performing these various and arduous duties
he exhibited great wisdom, a sound discretion, a clear head and
good heart. In the cabinet, as in the field, prudence and deliberation
guided his every action. He was found equal to every emergency and
duty that his country demanded at his hands—he acted up to, but never
exceeded the bounds of delegated authority—an angel could do no
more—Washington did no less. During his administration of eight
years he put forth the noblest energies of his lucid mind to advance the
prosperity of his country—meliorate the condition of those who were
suffering from the effects of a protracted war—improve the state of
society, arts, science, agriculture and commerce—disseminate general
intelligence—allay local difficulties—and render the infant republic
as happy and glorious as it was free and independent.</p>

<p>His exertions were crowned with success; his fondest anticipations
were realized; he finished the work his country had called him to perform;
the government stood on a basis firm as the rock of ages, and,
on the 4th of March, 1797, he resigned his power to the sovereign
people, retired from public life, honoured and loved by his fellow-citizens,
respected and admired by a gazing world, and crowned with an
unsullied fame that will endure unimpaired the revolutions of time.</p>

<p>He then retired to Mount Vernon to enjoy once more the felicity
of domestic retirement and the sweets of his own fireside. He had
served his country long and ably; he could look back upon a life well
and nobly spent in the cause of human rights, liberal principles and
universal philanthropy.</p>

<p>For his arduous services during the revolution Washington took no
compensation, and virtually paid about three-fourths of his own expenses.
He only charged his actual disbursements, for each item of
which he produced a written voucher. He made a book entry of every
business transaction with as much system as if he had enjoyed the quiet
of a counting-room. A fac simile of his journal is now before me, which
has been politely furnished by Timothy Caldwell, Esq. of the city of
Philadelphia, one of the few survivors of “the times that tried men’s
souls.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
The first entry is dated the 22nd of June, 1775, and marked No. 1.
£239. It commences with the outfit of the commander-in-chief and
his staff at Philadelphia, and the expenses of the journey to Cambridge,
immediately after his appointment by Congress, amounting to
£466 2<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> lawful money. But £3 of this amount was drawn
from government at that time. The balance was furnished from his
own pocket and credit, having received from Thomas Mifflin, Esq.,
£129 8<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> The account current which is before me runs through
a period of eight years, at the end of which time a balance was due to
him of £1972 9<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> His expenses for the eight years amounted to
£16311 17<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> He received $104,364 paper money, after March
1780, and passed it to the credit of the United States at forty for one,
agreeably to the scale of depreciation, for which he did not obtain one
for a hundred, by reason of which a large proportion of his expenses
were actually paid with his own private money, for which he refused
any remuneration. His expenses during his presidential terms exceeded
his salary over five thousand dollars a year, which he paid
from his private funds.</p>

<p>Had I time and power to trace the fair lines of Washington’s private
worth and routine of life, I would present the picture of a man
graced with native dignity, reducing all things around him to as perfect
a system of order, economy, harmony and peace, as was ever
devised by man. It should be chastened with sterling merit and
magnanimity, and mellowed with benevolence and charity. It should
be enlivened by the richest colours of virtue and consistency, and
finished with the finest touches of a master’s hand. I would crown
it with an amaranthine bouquet, richer and sweeter than the epic or
civic wreath that decked his brow in the public view of an admiring
world. He was a pattern of all that was great and good—the widow’s
solace, the orphan’s father, the bountiful benefactor, the faithful friend,
the kind husband, the true patriot, the humble christian, the worthy
citizen and the honest man.</p>

<p>With the exception of his appointment to preside over the American
army in 1798, when France threatened an invasion, Washington
was relieved from any further participation in public affairs. He
continued to live at Vernon’s sacred mount until the 14th of December,
1799, when his immortal spirit left its tenement of clay, soared
aloft on angel’s wings to realms of ceaseless bliss, there to receive
a crown of unfading glory, as the reward of a spotless life spent in
the service of his country and his God.</p>

<p>His body was deposited in the family tomb, where its ashes slumber
in peace, amidst the groves of his loved retreat.<a id="FNanchor_I" href="#Footnote_I" class="fnanchor">I</a> This hallowed spot
is visited yearly by large numbers, who approach it with veneration,
gratitude and awe. Foreigners are proud to say they have visited the
tomb of Washington—all nations revere his memory, unborn millions
will perpetuate his praise.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_I" href="#FNanchor_I" class="fnanchor">I</a> Since writing this sketch I have been informed, that when the remains of
Washington were placed in the sarcophagus prepared for their reception, in the
autumn of 1837, his face retained its fleshy appearance and was but slightly
changed—a fact as remarkable as the history of his life.</p></div>

<p><em>His</em> history, like that of our nation, is without a parallel. Unblemished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
virtue marked his whole career, philanthropy his whole course, justice
and integrity his every action. A calm resignation, to the will of God,
under the most trying circumstances and under every dispensation,
added a brilliant lustre to all his amiable qualities. His course was
not tarnished with bold strides of misguided ambition, or base attempts
at self-aggrandizement. He was consistent to the last. His character,
like a blazing luminary, outdazzles the surrounding stars, and
illuminates, with meridian splendour, the horizon of biography. His
brilliant achievements were not stained with that unnecessary effusion
of human blood which characterized the ambitious Cæsar, the conquering
Alexander and the disappointed Bonaparte. His fame is beyond
the reach of slander or the attacks of malice. He has left an
example of human conduct worthy the contemplation and imitation of
all who move in the private walks of life or figure on the stage of public
action. His sacred memory will live through the rolling ages of
time, until the wreck of worlds and the dissolution of nature shall
close the drama of human action, Gabriel’s dread clarion rend the
vaulted tomb, awake the sleeping dead, and proclaim to astonished
millions—<span class="smcap smaller">TIME SHALL BE NO LONGER</span>.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_59">PATRICK HENRY.</h2>
</div>

<p>This distinguished name stands conspicuous upon the pages of
the history of our country, and shines with peculiar brilliancy amidst
the constellations of the revolution. Time and the critic’s pen have
not detracted from the lustre of its fame—the patriot delights to dwell
upon the bright and bold career of <span class="smcap">Patrick Henry</span>.</p>

<p>He was a native of Studley, Hanover county, Virginia, born on the
29th of May, 1736. His father was a highly respectable man, of
Scotch descent; his mother was the sister of Judge Winston, who was
justly celebrated as an eloquent and forcible orator.</p>

<p>During his childhood and youth Patrick Henry was remarkable for
indolence and a love of recreation—consequently, he arrived at manhood
with a limited education and unaccustomed to industry. His
native talents were not developed, his mind was not cultivated, nor
his genius expanded, until after he was a husband and a father. His
friends endeavoured in vain to direct his course to a close application
to business by setting him up in the mercantile line. In this he soon
failed, preferring his fishing rod and gun to the business of his store.
After finding himself a bankrupt, he concluded that the toils of life
and the troubles of his pilgrimage were too much to bear alone, and
accordingly married a wife, the daughter of a respectable planter, and
became a tiller of the ground. Unacquainted with this new vocation,
he soon found himself in the quagmire of adversity, and again tacked
about and entered into the mercantile business. Still he was unfortunate,
and poverty claimed him as one of her favourite children. An
increasing family needed increased means of support, creditors became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
clamorous, duns showered in upon him, and in a short time
Patrick Henry was reduced to misery and want. At last he was
driven to his books, and resolved on the study of law. He now felt
most keenly the misspent time of his childhood and youth, and saw
many of his age who had already ascended high on the ladder of fame,
whose native powers of mind he knew to be inferior to his. He accordingly
commenced the study he had chosen, and in six weeks after,
at the age of twenty-four, he was admitted to the bar, more as a compliment
to his respectable connexions and his destitute situation, than
from the knowledge he had obtained of this lucid but laborious
science during the brief period he had been engaged in its investigation.—The
ensuing three years, folded in the coil of extreme want,
he made but slow advances in his profession, and obtained the necessaries
of life by assisting his father-in-law at a <em>tavern</em> bar, instead of
shining at the bar of the court. He was still ardently attached to his
gun, and often carried his knapsack of provisions and remained several
days and nights in the woods. On his return, he would enter the
court in his coarse and blood-stained hunting dress, when he would
take up his causes, carry them through with astonishing adroitness and
skill, and finally succeeded in gaining a popular reputation as an advocate.</p>

<p>In 1764, he was employed as counsel in a case of contested election
to be tried at the seat of the government of his native state, which
introduced him among the fashionable and gay, whose exterior appearance
and manners formed a great contrast with his. He made
no preparation for meeting his learned and polished adversaries, and
as he moved awkwardly around among them, was looked upon by
some who were gazing at his coarse habiliments and his eccentric
actions, as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">non compos mentis</i>. When the case came up for trial, the
astonished audience and the court were completely electrified by his
bursts of native eloquence and the cogency of his logic. Judges Tyler
and Winston who tried the case, declared they had never before witnessed
so happy and triumphant an effort, in point of sublime rhetoric
and conclusive argument, by any man. From that time forward the
fame of Patrick Henry spread its expansive wings, and he was enabled
to banish want and misery from his door by a lucrative and increasing
practice. From his childhood he had been a close observer of human
nature; the only remarkable trait in favour of his juvenile character.
He had always cultivated and improved this advantageous propensity,
which was of great use to him in after life. So well versed had he
become with the nature, propensities, and operations of the human
mind, that he seemed to comprehend and divine, at a single glance,
all its intricacies, impulses and variations. This gave him a great
advantage over many of his professional brethren, who had studied
Latin and Greek <em>more</em>, but human nature <em>less</em>, than this self-made
man. He took a deep and comprehensive view of the causes that
impel men to action, and of the results produced by the multifarious
influences that control and direct them. He investigated the designs
of creation, the duty of man to his fellow and his God, the laws of nature,
reason and revelation, and became a bold advocate for liberty of
conscience, equal rights and universal freedom. Nor did he bury<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
these principles of philanthropy in his own bosom. In the expansive
view he had taken of the rights of man, of the different modes of
government, of the oppression of kings, of the policy pursued by the
mother country towards the American colonies, he came to the conclusion,
that any nation to be great and happy, must be free and independent.</p>

<p>He had viewed, with a statesman’s eye, the growing oppressions of
the crown; they had reached his very soul, and roused that soul to
action. In Virginia, Patrick Henry first charged the revolutionary
ball with patriotic fire, and gave it an impetus that increased and
gathered new force as it rolled along. Had not the mighty theme of
freedom engaged the mind of this bold and elevated patriot, he might
have closed his career with its gigantic powers half unspent, and left
his noblest qualities of soul to expire in embryo. Nature had so
moulded him, that the ordinary concerns of life never roused him to
vigorous action. It required occasions of deep and thrilling interest
to awaken and put in motion his stronger energies. The exciting
cause of the revolution was exactly calculated to bring him out in all
the majesty of his native greatness.</p>

<p>In 1765, he was chosen a member of the Virginia Assembly, and
at once took a bold and decisive stand against British oppression.
He introduced resolutions against the stamp act that were so bold
and independent as to alarm the older members, who, although they
approved and applauded the principles and liberal views of this
young champion of liberty, wanted his moral courage to design and
execute. To impart this to them, and stamp the impress of his own
upon their trembling hearts, was now the great business of Patrick
Henry. In this he succeeded, and his resolutions were passed.
Each resolution was drawn from the translucent fountain of eternal
justice, equity and law, and was based upon the principles of Magna
Charta, which had been the polar star of England for centuries. The
following is a correct copy:</p>

<p>“Resolved, That the first adventurers and settlers of this his majesty’s
colony and dominion, brought with them, and transmitted to
their posterity, and all other his majesty’s subjects, since inhabiting
in this, his majesty’s said colony, all the privileges, franchises and
immunities, that have, at any time, been held, enjoyed and possessed
by the people of Great Britain.</p>

<p>“Resolved, That by two royal charters granted by King James I.,
the colonists aforesaid are declared entitled to all the privileges,
liberties and immunities of denizens and natural born subjects, to
all intents and purposes, as if they had been abiding and born within
the realm of England.</p>

<p>“Resolved, That the taxation of the people by themselves, or by
persons chosen by themselves to represent them, who can only know
what taxes the people are able to bear, and the easiest mode of
raising them, and are equally affected by such taxes themselves, is
the distinguishing characteristic of British freedom, and without
which the ancient constitution cannot subsist.</p>

<p>“Resolved, That his majesty’s liege people of this most ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>
colony, have uninterruptedly enjoyed the right of being thus governed
by their own Assembly, in the article of their taxes and internal police,
and that the same hath never been forfeited, or in any other way
given up, but hath been constantly recognised by the King and people
of Great Britain.</p>

<p>“Resolved therefore, that the general assembly of this colony has
the sole right and power to lay taxes and impositions upon the inhabitants
of this colony: and that every attempt to vest such power in
any person or persons whosoever, other than the general assembly
aforesaid, has a manifest tendency to destroy British as well as
American freedom!”</p>

<p>The justice of these resolutions, based as they were upon the well
known principles of the English constitution, confined within the
limits of the ancient landmarks of that sacred instrument, could not
be denied by the cringing sycophants of a corrupt and corrupting
ministry, and were hailed by every patriot as the firm pillars of the
temple of American liberty. They were enforced by the overwhelming
eloquence and logic of the mover, and seconded by Mr. Johnston,
who sustained them by arguments and conclusions that imparted
new strength and courage to many a bosom that was, a few moments
before, poising on the agonizing pivot of hesitation. They were
strongly opposed by several members, who subsequently espoused
the cause of equal rights, and affixed their names to the great charter
of our independence. This opposition brought forth, for the first
time, the gigantic powers of Patrick Henry. In all the sublimity of
his towering genius, he stood among the great, the acknowledged
champion of that legislative hall which he had but recently entered.
Astonishment and admiration held his electrified audience in deep
suspense as he painted, in bold and glowing colours, the increasing
infringements of the hirelings of the crown upon the chartered rights
and privileges of the colonists, who had waded through torrents of
blood and seas of trouble and toil, to plant themselves in the new
world. He pointed to the chains forged by the hands of tyranny,
already clanking, with terrific sound, upon every ear. To be free or
slaves, was the great, the momentous question. He, for one, was
prepared and determined to unfurl the banner of freedom, drive from
his native soil the task masters of oppression, or perish in the glorious
attempt. His opponents were completely astounded, and found
it impossible to stem the strong current of popular feeling put in motion
by the proceedings of that eventful crisis. Seconded and supported
by the cool and deep calculating Johnston, the resolutions
passed amidst the cry of “<em>treason</em>,” from the tories, and “<em>liberty or
death</em>,” from the patriots.</p>

<p>The seeds of freedom were deeply planted on that glorious day,
and old Virginia proved a congenial soil for the promotion of their
future growth. From that time forward, Patrick Henry was hailed
as the great advocate of human rights and rational liberty. He stood
on the loftiest pinnacle fame could rear, unmoved and unscathed by
the fire of persecution, calmly surveying the raging elements of the
revolutionary storm, already in commotion around him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
In August, 1774, the Virginia convention met at Williamsburg, and
passed a series of resolutions, pledging themselves to sustain their eastern
brethren in the common cause of their common country. As delegates
to the first colonial Congress they appointed Peyton Randolph,
Richard Henry Lee, George Washington, Richard Bland, Patrick
Henry, Benjamin Harrison and Edmund Pendleton.</p>

<p>On the 4th of September following, this august assembly of patriotic
sages and heroes met in Carpenters’ Hall, at the city of Philadelphia.
The object for which they had convened was one of imposing and
thrilling interest, big with events, absorbing in character and full of
importance. The eyes of gazing millions were turned upon them,
the kindling wrath of the crown was flashing before them, the anathemas
of tyranny were pronounced against them. But they still resolved
to go on. Liberty or death had become the watchword—the
hallowed fire of freedom had warmed their bosoms and impelled them
to action. After an address to the throne of grace, they commenced
their proceedings by appointing Peyton Randolph, of Virginia, president
of their body. A deep and solemn silence ensued, as if each
member was appealing to Heaven for aid and direction. At length
Patrick Henry rose, as echo lingered to catch a sound. With the
eloquence of a Demosthenes, the philosophy of a Socrates, the justice
of an Aristides, and the wisdom of a Solon, he took a broad, impartial
and expansive view of the past, the present and the future; exhibited,
in their true light, the relations between the mother country and her
distant colonies; unveiled the designs of the base and unprincipled
ministry that claimed the high and unwarranted prerogative of wielding
an iron sceptre over America, and of reducing her sons to unconditional
submission, and painted, in the most vivid and lively colours,
a nation’s rights and a nation’s wrongs. The dignity and calmness of
his manner, the clearness of his logic, the force of his eloquence and
the solemnity of his voice and countenance combined to inspire an
admiration and awe until then unknown to the astonished audience.
On that occasion his powers of thought seemed supernatural; he seemed
commissioned by Heaven to rouse his countrymen to a sense of
approaching danger. He sat down amidst repeated bursts of applause,
the acknowledged Demosthenes of the new world, the most powerful
orator of his day and generation.</p>

<p>The succeeding year he was a member of the convention of Virginia
that convened at Richmond, where he proposed immediate measures
of defence, sufficient to repel any invasion from the mother
country. In this he was strenuously opposed by several of the most
influential members, who still felt a disposition to cringe to royal
power.</p>

<p>That power, based as it was upon wrongs and injury, Patrick Henry
held in utter contempt. His dauntless soul soared above the trappings
of a crown, backed by military pomp and show, and looked for
rest only in the goal of liberty.</p>

<p>The following extract from his speech in that convention will best
convey a correct idea of his feelings and emotions, deeply felt and
strongly told.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
“Mr. President, it is natural for man to indulge in the illusions of
hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen
to the song of that syren till she transforms us into beasts. Is this
the part of wise men engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty!
Are we disposed to be of the number of those, who, having eyes
see not, and having ears hear not the things that so nearly concern
their temporal salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it
may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth—to know the worst
and provide for it.</p>

<p>“I have but one lamp to guide my feet, and that is the lamp of experience.
I know of no way of judging the future but by the past. Judging
from the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of
the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with
which gentlemen are pleased to solace themselves and the house? Is
it that insidious smile with which our petition has lately been received?
Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves
to be betrayed by a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception
of our petition comports with those warlike preparations that
cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies necessary
to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves
so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back
our love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements
of war and subjugation—the last arguments to which kings resort.
I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array if its purpose
be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any
other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy in this
quarter of the world to call for all this accumulation of navies and
armies? No, sir; she has none. They are meant for us—they can
be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us
those chains which the British ministry have been so long forging.
And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir,
we have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we any thing
new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject
up in every light of which it is capable, but it has been all in vain.
Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms
shall we find which have not already been exhausted? Let us not, I
beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves longer. Sir, we have done every
thing that could be done to avert the storm that is coming on. We
have petitioned—we have remonstrated—we have supplicated—we
have prostrated ourselves before the throne and have implored its
interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and parliament.
Our petitions have been slighted, our remonstrances have
produced additional violence and insult, our supplications have been
disregarded, and we have been spurned with contempt from the foot of
the throne.</p>

<p>“In vain after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace
and reconciliation. <em>There is no longer any room for hope.</em> If we
wish to be free; if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable
privileges for which we have been so long contending; if we mean
not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon
until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained, <em>we must
fight</em>! I repeat it, sir, <em>we must fight</em>! An appeal to arms and the
God of Hosts is all that is left us! It is vain, sir, to extenuate the
matter. Gentlemen may cry peace, peace; but there is no peace.
The war is actually begun. The next gale that comes from the north,
will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren
are already in the field. Why stand we here idle? What is it that
gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace
so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid
it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take, but
as for me, <em>give me liberty or death</em>!”</p>

<p>The effect of this speech was electrical. The cry, “<em>to arms</em>,” burst
from every quarter—“<em>liberty or death</em>,” resounded and rang through
every ear and was responded by every patriot. The resolutions were
seconded and supported by Richard Henry Lee, and were adopted
without further opposition. A committee was immediately appointed
to carry them into effect. From that time forward, the old dominion
was renewed, regenerated, and free. Her richest blood was poured
out freely in the cause of liberty and equal rights.</p>

<p>Soon after this convention had adjourned, Lord Dunmore removed
a part of the powder from the magazine at Williamsburg on board of
one of his majesty’s ships. On being informed of this transaction,
Patrick Henry collected a military force in Hanover and King William
counties, and repaired to the seat of government, demanding the restoration
of the powder or its equivalent in cash. An order for the amount
in money was received, and no blood shed. A proclamation was issued
against these daring rebels, which only seemed to unite the people
more strongly in favour of their orator and soldier, whose conduct they
highly approved at several public meetings convened on the occasion.</p>

<p>In August, 1775, Mr. Henry was again chosen a delegate to the
Continental Congress, and in June of the following year, governor of
his native state. He held this important office during that and the
ensuing year, but declined serving the third year, although unanimously
re-elected. His zeal in the glorious cause he had espoused
did not languish or grow cold. In 1780 he took his seat in the assembly
of his state, and manifested all the activity and vigour that
characterized the commencement of his bold and useful career. In
1788 he was a member of the Virginia convention convened for the
consideration of the constitution of the United States, then submitted
for approval or rejection. To that instrument Mr. Henry was then
strongly opposed, because, as he contended, it consolidated the states
into one government, thereby destroying the sovereignty of each. His
eloquence on that occasion was raised to its highest pitch, but could
not prevail. His resolution against it was lost. His closing speech
on that now revered instrument, was said to have surpassed either of
his former efforts, and operated so powerfully, that but a small majority
voted for the new constitution. During his remarks an incident
occurred which enabled him to almost paralyze his audience. After
describing the magnitude of the question, on the determination of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>
which hung the happiness or woe of the present generation, and millions
yet unborn, with a voice and countenance solemn as eternity,
and his eyes raised upwards, he appealed to the God of heaven and
to angels then hovering over their heads, to witness the thrilling
scene, and invoked their aid in the mighty work before him. At that
moment a sudden thunder gust commenced its fury and shook the
very earth. Upon the wings of the tempest his stentorian voice continued
to rise—he figuratively seized the artillery of the elements as
by supernatural power, hurled the liquid lightning at the heads of his
opponents, and seemed commissioned by the great Jehovah to execute
a deed of vengeance. The scene was awfully sublime, the effect
tremendous. The purple current rushed back upon the fountain
of life, every countenance was pale, every eye was fixed, every
muscle was electrified, every vein was contracted, every heart was
agonized, the scene became insupportable, the members rushed from
their seats in confusion and left the house without the formality of an
adjournment.</p>

<p>He remained in the assembly until 1791, when he declined a re-election,
and expressed a strong desire to retire from public life. He
had toiled long, faithfully and successfully, and wished for that repose
found only in the bosom of our families.</p>

<p>In 1795, president Washington, for whom he had an unbounded
veneration, offered him the high station of secretary of state. With
becoming gratitude to his friend and the father of his country, he declined
the proffered honour, and chose to remain in retirement. The
following year he was again elected governor of his native state, but
declined serving. In 1799 he was appointed by president Adams an
envoy to France in conjunction with Messrs. Murray and Ellsworth.
His declining health would not permit him to accept of this last appointment
with which he was honoured. Disease was fast consummating
the work of death, and destroying rapidly the hardy constitution
and athletic frame that had enabled him to perform his duty so nobly
during the trying scenes of the revolution. He was aware that the
work of dissolution was going on, and awaited his final exit with calm
submission and Christian fortitude. On the 6th of June, 1799, he resigned
his spirit to Him who gave it, threw off the mortal coil and
was numbered with the dead, aged but 61 years. His loss was deeply
mourned by the American nation, and most strongly felt by those
who knew him best. The following affectionate tribute is from the
pen of one who knew him well.</p>

<p>“Mourn, Virginia, mourn! your Henry is gone. Ye friends to
liberty in every clime, drop a tear. No more will his social feelings
spread delight through his happy house. No more will his edifying example
dictate to his numerous offspring the sweetness of virtue and
the majesty of patriotism. No more will his sage advice, guided by
zeal for the common happiness, impart light and utility to his caressing
neighbours. No more will he illuminate the public councils with
sentiments drawn from the cabinet of his own mind, ever directed to
his country’s good, and clothed in eloquence sublime, delightful and
commanding. Farewell, first rate patriot, farewell. As long as our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
rivers flow, or mountains stand, so long will your excellence and worth
be the theme of our homage and endearment; and Virginia, bearing in
mind her loss, will say to rising generations—imitate my Henry.”</p>

<p>In reviewing the character of this truly great man from the commencement
of his public career, his examples in public and private life
are worthy of veneration and the closest imitation. The rust of his
youth was soon removed, and he became in all respects a brilliant and
polished man. His habits were rigidly temperate, his conduct, as a
gentleman, a public functionary, an amiable citizen and a devoted
christian, was beyond reproach. Although when he believed himself
in the right, he maintained his position with great zeal and ardour, he
was always open to conviction. Although he opposed the adoption of
the federal constitution when it was under consideration, he subsequently
became convinced of its utility, and highly approved of its
form and substance.</p>

<p>As a husband, a father, a master, a neighbour and a friend, he had
no superior. As an advocate, an orator, a statesman and a patriot, his
fame stands in all its glory, uneclipsed and unsurpassed. As Grattan
said of Pitt, there was something in Patrick Henry that could create,
subvert, or reform; an understanding, a spirit, an eloquence to summon
mankind to society, or to break the bonds of slavery asunder, and
to rule the wilderness of free minds with unbounded authority; something
that could establish or overwhelm empire, and strike a blow in
the world that should resound through the universe.</p>

<p>He was twice married and the father of fifteen children. The
closing paragraph of his will is worthy of record, and shows the veneration
he felt for the religion of the Cross.</p>

<p>“I have now disposed of all my property to my family; there is one
thing more I wish I could give them, and that is the christian religion.
If they had this and I had not given them one shilling, they
would be rich; and if they had not that, and I had given them all the
world, they would be poor.” This short paragraph, coming from one
of the most gigantic minds that ever investigated the truths of revelation,
speaks volumes in favour of that religion which is despised by
some—neglected by millions—and is the one thing needful to fit us
for heaven and prepare us for the</p>

<p class="in0">
Friends and Fellow Citizens,
</p>

<p>The period for a new election of a citizen to administer the executive
government of the United States being not far distant, and
the time actually arrived when your thoughts must be employed in
designating the person who is to be clothed with that important trust,
it appears to me proper, especially as it may conduce to a more distinct
expression of the public voice, that I should now apprise you of
the resolution I have formed—to decline being considered among the
number of those out of whom a choice is to be made.</p>

<p>I beg you, at the same time, to do me the justice to be assured,
that this resolution has not been taken without a strict regard to all
the considerations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful
citizen to his country, and that, in withdrawing the tender of service,
which silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by
no diminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful
respect for your past kindness—but am supported by a full conviction
that the step is compatible with both.</p>

<p>The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in, the office to which
your suffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform sacrifice of
inclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what appeared
to be your desire. I constantly hoped, that it would have
been much earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I
was not at liberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from
which I had been reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination
to do this, previous to the last election, had even led to the preparation
of an address to declare it to you. But mature reflection
on the then perplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign
nations, and the unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence,
impelled me to abandon the idea.</p>

<p>I rejoice that the state of your concerns, external as well as internal,
no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible with the
sentiment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever partiality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
may be retained for my services, that, in the present circumstances
of our country, you will not disapprove my determination to
retire.</p>

<p>The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust,
were explained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this
trust I will only say, that I have with good intentions contributed
towards the organization and administration of the government the
best exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not
unconscious, in the outset, of the inferiority of my qualifications, experience
in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others,
has strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself: and every day
the increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that
the shade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome.
Satisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my
services, they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe, that
while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism
does not forbid it.</p>

<p>In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate
the career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend
the deep acknowledgement of that debt of gratitude which I owe to
my beloved country, for the many honours it has conferred upon me;
still more for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported
me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting
my inviolable attachment, by services faithful and persevering, though
in usefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our
country from these services, let it always be remembered to your
praise, and as an instructive example in our annals, that, under circumstances
in which the passions, agitated in every direction, were
liable to mislead; amidst appearances sometimes dubious; vicissitudes
of fortune often discouraging; in situations in which not unfrequently
want of success has countenanced the spirit of criticism, the
constancy of your support was the essential prop of the efforts, and a
guarantee of the plans by which they were effected. Profoundly
penetrated with this idea, I shall carry it with me to my grave, as a
strong incitement to unceasing vows that Heaven may continue to
you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; that your union and brotherly
affection may be perpetual! that a free constitution, which is
the work of your hands, may be sacredly maintained, that its administration,
in every department, may be stamped with wisdom and virtue;
that, in fine, the happiness of the people of these states, under
the auspices of Heaven, may be made complete by so careful a preservation
and so prudent a use of liberty, as will acquire to them the
glory of recommending it to the applause, the affection and the adoption
of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.</p>

<p>Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare,
which cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger,
natural to that solicitude, urge me, on an occasion like the present,
to offer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent
review, some sentiments, which are the result of much reflection,
of no inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>all-important
to the permanency of your felicity as a people. These
will be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only see in
them the disinterested warnings of a parting friend, who can possibly
have no personal motive to bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an
encouragement to it, your indulgent reception of my sentiments on a
former, and not dissimilar occasion.</p>

<p>Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your
hearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm
the attachment.</p>

<p>The unity of government which constitutes you one people, is also
now dear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice
of your real independence; the support of your tranquillity at home,
your peace abroad—of your safety—of your prosperity—of that very
liberty which you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee, that
from different causes and from different quarters, much pains will be
taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction
of this truth; as this is the point in your political fortress against
which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most
constantly and actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed,
it is of infinite moment, that you should properly estimate the
immense value of your national Union, to your collective and individual
happiness; that you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and
immovable attachment to it; accustoming yourselves to think and
speak of it as of the Palladium of your political safety and prosperity;
watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing
whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any
event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning
of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the
rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various
parts.</p>

<p>For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest.
Citizens, by birth or choice, of a common country, that country has
a right to concentrate your affections. The name of <span class="smcap">American</span>, which
belongs to you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just
pride of patriotism, more than any appellation derived from local discrimination.—With
slight shades of difference, you have the same religion,
manners, habits and political principles. You have, in a common
cause, fought and triumphed together. The independence and liberty
you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts; of
common dangers, sufferings and successes.</p>

<p>But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves
to your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply
more immediately to your interest. Here every portion of our
country finds the most commanding motives for carefully guarding
and preserving the union of the whole.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap smaller">NORTH</span>, in an unrestrained intercourse with the <span class="smcap smaller">SOUTH</span>, protected
by the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions
of the latter, great additional resources of maritime and
commercial enterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry.
The <span class="smcap smaller">SOUTH</span>, in the same intercourse benefitting by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>
agency of the <span class="smcap smaller">NORTH</span>, sees its agriculture grow, and its commerce
expand. Turning partly into its own channels the seamen of the North,
it finds its particular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes,
in different ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the
national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime
strength, to which itself is unequally adapted. The <span class="smcap smaller">EAST</span>, in a like
intercourse with the west, already finds, and in the progressive improvement
of interior communications, by land and water, will more
and more find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings
from abroad, or manufactures at home. The <span class="smcap smaller">WEST</span> derives from the
<span class="smcap smaller">EAST</span> supplies requisite to its growth and comfort; and what is, perhaps,
of still greater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure
enjoyment of indispensable outlets for its own production, to the
weight, influence, and the future maritime strength of the Atlantic
side of the union, directed by an indissoluble community of interest,
as one nation. Any other tenure, by which the west can hold this
essential advantage, whether derived from its own separate strength,
or from an apostate or unnatural connexion with any foreign power,
must be intrinsically precarious.</p>

<p>While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and
particular interest in union, all the parties combined cannot fail to
find, in the united mass of means and efforts, greater strength,
greater resource, proportionably greater security from external danger,
a less frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations.
And, what is of inestimable value, they must derive from union an
exemption from those broils and wars between themselves, which so
frequently afflict neighbouring countries, not tied together by the
same government; which their own rivalships alone would be sufficient
to produce, but which opposite foreign alliances, attachments
and intrigues, would stimulate and embitter. Hence, likewise, they
will avoid the necessity of those overgrown military establishments,
which under any form of government are inauspicious to liberty, and
which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty.
In this sense it is, that your union ought to be considered as a main
prop of your liberty, and that love of the one ought to endear to you
the preservation of the other.</p>

<p>These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting
and virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance in the <span class="smcap smaller">UNION</span> as a
primary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt, whether a common
government can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience
solve it. To listen to mere speculation, in such a case, were criminal.
We are authorized to hope that a proper organization of the
whole, with the auxiliary agency of governments for the respective
subdivisions, will afford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well
worth a fair and full experiment. With such powerful and obvious
motives to Union, affecting all parts of our country, while experience
shall not have demonstrated its impracticability, there will always be
reason to distrust the patriotism of those, who, in any quarter, may
endeavour to weaken its bands.</p>

<p>In contemplating the causes which may disturb our union, it occurs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
as a matter of serious concern, that any ground should have
been furnished for characterizing parties by <span class="smcap smaller">GEOGRAPHICAL</span> discriminations;
<span class="smcap smaller">NORTHERN</span> and <span class="smcap smaller">SOUTHERN</span>; <span class="smcap smaller">ATLANTIC</span> and <span class="smcap smaller">WESTERN</span>; whence
designing men may endeavour to excite a belief that there is a real difference
of local interests and views. One of the expedients of party
to acquire influence within particular districts, is to misrepresent the
opinions and aims of other districts. You cannot shield yourselves
too much against the jealousies and heart burnings which spring from
these misrepresentations; they tend to render alien to each other those
who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection. The inhabitants
of our western country have lately had a useful lesson on this
head; they have seen, in the negotiation by the executive, and in the
unanimous ratification by the senate of the treaty with Spain, and in
the universal satisfaction at that event throughout the United States,
a decisive proof how unfounded were the suspicions propagated among
them, of a policy in the general government, and in the Atlantic
states, unfriendly to their interest in regard to the Mississippi. They
have been witnesses to the formation of two treaties: that with Great
Britain and that with Spain; which secure to them every thing they
could desire, in respect to our foreign relations, towards confirming
their prosperity. Will it not be their wisdom to rely for the preservation
of these advantages on the union by which they were procured?
Will they not henceforth be deaf to those advisers, if such there are,
who would sever them from their brethren and connect them with
aliens?</p>

<p>To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for
the whole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between
the parts, can be an adequate substitute; they must inevitably experience
the infractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times
have experienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved
upon your first essay by the adoption of a constitution of
government better calculated than your former for an intimate union,
and for the efficacious management of your common concerns. This
government, the offspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed,
adopted upon full investigation and mature deliberation, completely
free in its principles, in the distribution of its powers, uniting
security with energy, and containing within itself a provision for its
own amendment, has a just claim to your confidence and your support.
Respect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence
in its measures, are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims
of true liberty. The basis of our political systems is the right of the
people to make and alter their constitutions of government. But the
constitution which at any time exists, till changed by an explicit and
authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all.
The very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish
government, presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the
established government.</p>

<p>All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and
associations, under whatever plausible character, with a real design
to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>
action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental
principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction;
to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the
place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a
small, but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and,
according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the
public administration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous
projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome
plans, digested by common counsels, and modified by mutual interests.</p>

<p>However combinations or associations of the above description may
now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of
time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious
and unprincipled men, will be enabled to subvert the power of
the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government; destroying
afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust
dominion.</p>

<p>Towards the preservation of your government, and the permanency
of your present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily
discountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority, but
also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles,
however specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be
to effect in the forms of the constitution, alterations which will impair
the energy of the system, and thus to undermine what cannot be directly
overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited,
remember, that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true
character of governments as of other human institutions; that experience
is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of the
existing constitution of a country; that facility in change upon the
credit of mere hypothesis and opinion, exposes to perpetual change
from the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion; and remember,
especially, that for the efficient management of your common interests
in a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigour as
is consistent with the perfect security of liberty, is indispensable.
Liberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly
distributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is, indeed, little else
than a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the enterprises
of faction, to confine each member of the society within the
limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure and
tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.</p>

<p>I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state,
with the particular reference to the founding of them on geographical
discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and
warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the
spirit of party generally.</p>

<p>This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having
its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under
different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled,
or repressed. But in those of the popular form, it is seen in its greatest
rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>
The alternate dominion of one faction over another, sharpened by
the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which, in different
ages and countries, has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is
itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a formal and
permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result,
gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in
the absolute power of an individual: and, sooner or later, the chief
of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors,
turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on
the ruins of public liberty.</p>

<p>Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which, nevertheless,
ought not to be entirely out of sight,) the common and
continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the
interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.</p>

<p>It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the
public administration. It agitates the community with ill founded
jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against
another; foments occasionally riot and insurrection; and opens the
door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access
to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus
the policy and will of one country are subjected to the policy and will
of another.</p>

<p>There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks
upon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive
the spirit of liberty. This, within certain limits, is probably true:
and in governments of a monarchial cast, patriotism may look with
indulgence, if not with favour, upon the spirit of party. But in those
of the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit
not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there
will always be enough of this spirit for every salutary purpose. And
there being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be, by force
of public opinion, to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched,
it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame,
lest, instead of warming, it should consume.</p>

<p>It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking, in a free country,
should inspire caution in those intrusted with its administration,
to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres,
avoiding, in the exercise of the power of one department, to encroach
upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the
powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the
form of government, a real despotism. A just estimate of that love of
power, and proneness to abuse it, which predominates in the human
heart, is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position. The necessity
of reciprocal checks, in the exercise of political power, by dividing
and distributing it into different depositories, and constituting each
the guardian of public weal against invasions by the others, has been
evinced by experiments ancient and modern; some of them in our
country and under our own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary
as to institute them. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution
or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular
wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>
constitution designates. But let there be no change by usurpation;
for though this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is
the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. The
precedent must always greatly overbalance, in permanent evil, any
partial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield.</p>

<p>Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity,
religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that
man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labour to subvert
these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties
of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious
man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace
all their connexions with private and public felicity. Let it be simply
asked, where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if
the sense of religious obligations desert the oaths, which are the instruments
of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with caution
indulge the supposition, that morality can be maintained without
religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education
on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both
forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of
religious principle. It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is
a necessary spring of popular government. The rule indeed extends
with more or less force to every species of free government. Who
that is a sincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts
to shake the foundation of the fabric?</p>

<p>Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for
the general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of
a government gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public
opinion should be enlightened.</p>

<p>As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public
credit. One method of preserving it, is to use it as sparingly as possible;
avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace; but remembering
also that timely disbursements to <em>prepare</em> for danger frequently
prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding likewise the
accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of expense, but
by vigorous exertions, in time of peace, to discharge the debts which
unavoidable wars may have occasioned; not ungenerously throwing
upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. The
execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives; but it is
necessary that public opinion should co-operate. To facilitate to them
the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should practically
bear in mind, that towards the payment of debts there must be
revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can
be devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant;
that the intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the
proper object, (which is always a choice of difficulties,) ought to be a
decisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the government
in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the measures
for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any
time dictate.</p>

<p>Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>
and harmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct:
and can it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be
worthy of a free, enlightened, and at no distant period, a great nation,
to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people
always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can doubt
that in the course of time and things, the fruits of such a plan would
richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a steady
adherence to it? Can it be that providence has not connected the
permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment at
least is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature.
Alas! is it rendered impossible by its vices!</p>

<p>In the execution of such a plan, nothing is more essential than that
permanent inveterate antipathies against particular nations, and passionate
attachment for others, should be excluded; and that in place
of them, just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated.
The nation, which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an
habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity
or to its affections, either of which is sufficient to lead it
astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation
against another, disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury,
to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable,
when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. Hence
frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed and bloody contests. The
nation, prompted by ill-will and resentment, sometimes impels to war
the government, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The government
sometimes participates in the national propensity, and adopts
through passion, what reason would reject; at other times, it makes
the animosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated
by pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious motives.
The peace, often, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations has been
the victim. So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for
another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favourite nation,
facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest, in cases
where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities
of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels
and wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or justification.
It leads also to concessions to the favourite nation, of privileges
denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the
concessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been
retained; and by exciting jealousy, ill-will, and a disposition to retaliate,
in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld: and it
gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens, (who devote themselves
to the favourite nation,) facility to betray or sacrifice the interests
of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with popularity;
gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligations,
commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public
good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, corruption or
infatuation.</p>

<p>As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments
are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>
patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with
domestic factions, to practise the arts of seduction, to mislead public
opinion, to influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment
of a small or weak, towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the
former to be the satellite of the latter.</p>

<p>Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence, (I conjure you to
believe me, fellow citizens,) the jealousy of a free people ought to be
<span class="smcap smaller">CONSTANTLY</span> awake; since history and experience prove that foreign
influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government.
But that jealousy, to be useful, must be impartial; else it becomes the
instrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defence
against it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation, and excessive
dislike of another, cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on
one side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on the
other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favourite,
are liable to become suspected and odious; while its tools and dupes
usurp the applause and confidence of the people, to surrender their
interests.</p>

<p>The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is,
in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little
<em>political</em> connection as possible. So far as we have already formed
engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let
us stop.</p>

<p>Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none, or a
very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies,
the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns.
Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by
artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary
combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities. Our
detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different
course. If we remain one people, under an efficient government,
the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from
external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will cause
the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon, to be scrupulously
respected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making
acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation;
when we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by justice,
shall counsel.</p>

<p>Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit
our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our
destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity
in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humour,
or caprice.</p>

<p>It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any
portion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty
to do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity
to existing engagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable
to public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy.
I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>
genuine sense. But in my opinion it is unnecessary and would be
unwise to extend them.</p>

<p>Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments,
in a respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary
alliances for extraordinary emergencies.</p>

<p>Harmony and a liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended
by policy, humanity and interest. But even our commercial
policy should hold an equal and impartial hand; neither seeking nor
granting exclusive favours or preferences; consulting the natural course
of things; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of
commerce, but forcing nothing: establishing, with powers so disposed,
in order to give trade a stable course, to define the rights of our merchants,
and to enable the government to support them, conventional
rules of intercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual
opinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time
abandoned or varied, as experience and circumstances shall dictate;
constantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for
disinterested favours from another; that it must pay with a portion of
its independence for whatever it may accept under that character;
that by such acceptance, it may place itself in the condition of having
given equivalents for nominal favours, and yet of being reproached
with ingratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error
than to expect or calculate upon real favours from nation to nation.
It is an illusion which experience must cure—which a just pride ought
to discard.</p>

<p>In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and
affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and
lasting impression I could wish; that they will control the usual current
of the passions, or prevent our nation from running the course
which has hitherto marked the destiny of nations! but, if I may even
flatter myself, that they may be productive of some partial benefit,
some occasional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate
the fury of party spirit; to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue;
to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism; this
hope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare, by
which they have been dictated.</p>

<p>How far, in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided
by the principles which have been delineated, the public records and
other evidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world.
To myself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have at least
believed myself to be guided by them.</p>

<p>In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation
of the 22nd of April, 1793, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by
your approving voice, and by that of your representatives in both
houses of Congress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed
me, uninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.</p>

<p>After a deliberate examination, with the aid of the best lights I
could obtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the circumstances
of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty
and interest, to take a neutral position. Having taken it, I determined,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>
as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with moderation,
perseverance and firmness. The considerations which respect
the right to hold this conduct, it is not necessary on this occasion to
detail. I will only observe, that according to my understanding of
the matter, that right, so far from being denied by any of the belligerent
powers, has been virtually admitted by all.</p>

<p>The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred without any
thing more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on
every nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain inviolate
the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.</p>

<p>The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will be best
referred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant
motive has been to endeavour to gain time to our country to
settle and mature its yet recent institutions, and to progress, without
interruption, to that degree of strength and consistency, which is
necessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own fortunes.</p>

<p>Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am unconscious
of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my
defects, not to think it probable that I may have committed many
errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to
avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry
with me the hope that my country will never cease to view them with
indulgence; and that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its
service, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will
be consigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of
rest.</p>

<p>Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by
that fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in
it the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several generations,
I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in which I promise
myself to realize, without alloy, the sweet enjoyment of partaking in
the midst of my fellow-citizens the benign influence of good laws under
a free government; the ever favourite object of my heart, and the
happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labours and dangers.</p>

<span class="bold">A DECLARATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="hang">BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED COLONIES OF NORTH AMERICA,
SETTING FORTH THE CAUSES AND NECESSITY OF THEIR TAKING UP
ARMS.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Directed to be published by General Washington, upon his arrival
before Boston.</i></p>

<p class="p2">If it was possible for men, who exercise their reason, to believe
that the Divine author of our existence intended a part of the human
race to hold an absolute property in and an unbounded power over
others, marked out by his infinite goodness and wisdom as the objects
of a legal domination never rightfully resistible, however severe and oppressive,
the inhabitants of these colonies might at least require from
the parliament of Great Britain some evidence that this dreadful authority
over them has been granted to that body. But a reverence for
our great Creator, principles of humanity and the dictates of common
sense, must convince all those who reflect upon the subject, that government
was instituted to promote the welfare of mankind, and ought
to be administered for the attainment of that end. The legislature of
Great Britain, however, stimulated by an inordinate passion for a
power, not only unjustifiable, but which they know to be peculiarly
reprobated by the very constitution of that kingdom, and desperate of
success in any mode of contest, where regard should be had to truth,
law or right, have at length, deserting those, attempted to effect their
cruel and impolitic purpose of enslaving these colonies by violence,
and have thereby rendered it necessary for us to close with their last
appeal from reason to arms. Yet, however blinded that assembly may
be, by their intemperate rage for unlimited domination, so to slight
justice and the opinion of mankind, we esteem ourselves bound by
obligations of respect to the rest of the world, to make known the
justice of our cause.</p>

<p>Our forefathers, inhabitants of the island of Great Britain, left their
native land to seek on these shores a residence for civil and religious
freedom. At the expense of their blood, at the hazard of their fortunes,
without the least charge to the country from which they removed,
by unceasing labour and an unconquerable spirit, they effected
settlements in the distant and inhospitable wilds of America, then
filled with numerous and warlike nations of barbarians. Societies or
governments, vested with perfect legislatures, were formed under charters
from the crown, and an harmonious intercourse was established<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>
between the colonies and the kingdom from which they derived their
origin. The mutual benefits of this union became in a short time so
extraordinary as to excite astonishment. It is universally confessed
that the amazing increase of the wealth, strength and navigation of
the realm arose from this source; and the minister, who so wisely and
successfully directed the measures of Great Britain in the late war,
publicly declared, that these colonies enabled them to triumph over
her enemies. Towards the conclusion of that war it pleased our sovereign
to make a change in his counsels. From that fatal moment the
affairs of the British empire began to fall into confusion, and gradually
sliding from the summit of glorious prosperity, to which they
had been advanced by the virtues and abilities of one man, are at
length distracted by the convulsions that now shake it to its deepest
foundations. The new ministry finding the brave foes of Britain,
though frequently defeated, yet still contending, took up the unfortunate
idea of granting them a hasty peace, and of then subduing her
faithful friends.</p>

<p>These devoted colonies were judged to be in such a state as to present
victories without bloodshed, and all the easy emoluments of statuteable
plunder. The uninterrupted tenor of their peaceable and
respectful behaviour from the beginning of colonization, their dutiful,
zealous and useful services during the war, though so recently and
amply acknowledged in the most honourable manner by his majesty,
by the late king and by parliament, could not save them from the
meditated innovations. Parliament was influenced to adopt the pernicious
project, and, assuming a new power over them, have, in the
course of eleven years, given such decisive specimens of the spirit and
consequences attending this power, as to leave no doubt concerning
the effects of acquiescence under it. They have undertaken to give
and grant our money without our consent, though we have ever exercised
an exclusive right to dispose of our own property; statutes have
been passed for extending the jurisdiction of courts of admiralty and
vice-admiralty beyond their ancient limits; for depriving us of the
accustomed and inestimable privilege of trial by jury, in cases affecting
both life and property; for suspending the legislature of one of the
colonies; for interdicting all commerce to the capital of another; and
for altering, fundamentally, the form of government established by
charter, and secured by acts of its own legislature solemnly confirmed
by the crown; for exempting the “murderers” of colonists from
legal trial, and, in effect, from punishment; for erecting in a neighbouring
province, acquired by the joint arms of Great Britain and
America, a despotism dangerous to our very existence; and for quartering
soldiers upon the colonists in time of profound peace. It has
also been resolved in parliament that colonists, charged with committing
certain offences, shall be transported to England to be tried.</p>

<p>But why should we enumerate our injuries in detail? By one statute
it is declared, that parliament can “of right make laws to bind
us in all cases whatsoever.” What is to defend us against so enormous,
so unlimited a power? Not a single man of those who assume it is
chosen by us, or is subject to our control or influence; but, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>
they are all of them exempt from the operation of such laws,
and an American revenue, if not diverted from the ostensible purposes
for which it is raised, would actually lighten their own burthens in
proportion as they increase ours. We saw the misery to which such
despotism would reduce us. We for ten years incessantly and ineffectually
besieged the throne as supplicants; we reasoned, we remonstrated
with parliament in the most mild and decent language.</p>

<p>The administration, sensible that we should regard these oppressive
measures as freemen ought to do, sent over fleets and armies to enforce
them. The indignation of the Americans was roused, it is true—but
it was the indignation of a virtuous, loyal and affectionate people.
A Congress of delegates from the united colonies was assembled
at Philadelphia on the fifth day of last September. We resolved again
to offer an humble and dutiful petition to the king, and also addressed
our fellow subjects of Great Britain. We have pursued every temperate,
every respectful measure; we have even proceeded to break
off our commercial intercourse with our fellow subjects, as the last
peaceable admonition, that our attachment to no nation upon earth
should supplant our attachment to liberty. This we flattered ourselves
was the ultimate step of the controversy: but subsequent events
have shown how vain was this hope of finding moderation in our enemies.</p>

<p>Several threatening expressions against the colonies were inserted in
his majesty’s speech; our petition, though we were told it was a decent
one, and that his majesty had been pleased to receive it graciously,
and to promise laying it before his parliament, was huddled into both
houses among a bundle of American papers and there neglected. The
lords and commons in their address, in the month of February, said,
that a rebellion at that time actually existed within the province of
Massachusetts Bay; and that those concerned in it had been countenanced
and encouraged by unlawful combinations and engagements,
entered into by his majesty’s subjects in several of the other colonies;
and therefore they besought his majesty that he would take the most
effectual measures to enforce due obedience to the laws and authority
of the supreme legislature. Soon after, the commercial intercourse
of whole colonies with foreign countries and with each other was cut
off by an act of parliament: by another, several of them were entirely
prohibited from the fisheries in the seas near their coast, on which they
always depended for their sustenance; and large reinforcements of
ships and troops were immediately sent over to General Gage.</p>

<p>Fruitless were all the intreaties, arguments, and eloquence of an
illustrious band of the most distinguished peers and commoners,
who nobly and strenuously asserted the justice of our cause, to stay,
or even to mitigate the heedless fury with which these accumulated
and unexampled outrages were hurried on. Equally fruitless was
the interference of the city of London, of Bristol, and many other
respectable towns in our favour. Parliament adopted an insidious
manœuvre calculated to divide us, to establish a perpetual auction of
taxations, where colony should bid against colony, all of them uninformed
what ransom would redeem their lives; and thus to extort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">328</a></span>
from us, at the point of the bayonet, the unknown sums that would
be sufficient to gratify, if possible to gratify, ministerial rapacity,
with the miserable indulgence left to us of raising, in our own mode,
the prescribed tribute. What terms more rigid and humiliating could
have been dictated by remorseless victors to conquered enemies? In
our circumstances to accept them, would be to deserve them.</p>

<p>Soon after the intelligence of these proceedings arrived on this
continent, General Gage, who in the course of the last year had taken
possession of the town of Boston, in the province of Massachusetts Bay,
and still occupied it as a garrison, on the 19th day of April, sent out
from that place a large detachment of his army, who made an unprovoked
assault on the inhabitants of the said province, at the town of
Lexington, as appears by the affidavits of a great number of persons,
some of whom were officers and soldiers of that detachment, murdered
eight of the inhabitants, and wounded many others. From thence
the troops proceeded in warlike array to the town of Concord, where
they set upon another party of the inhabitants of the same province,
killing several and wounding more, until compelled to retreat by the
country people suddenly assembled to repel this cruel aggression.
Hostilities, thus commenced by the British troops, have been since
prosecuted by them without regard to faith or reputation. The inhabitants
of Boston being confined within that town by the general,
their governor, and having, in order to procure their dismission,
entered into a treaty with him, it was stipulated that the said inhabitants,
having deposited their arms with their own magistrates, should
have liberty to depart, taking with them their other effects. They
accordingly delivered up their arms; but, in open violation of honour,
in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even savage nations
esteem sacred, the governor ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid,
that they might be preserved for their owners, to be seized by a body
of soldiers; detained the greatest part of the inhabitants in the town,
and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their
most valuable effects behind.</p>

<p>By this perfidy, wives are separated from their husbands, children
from their parents, the aged and the sick from their relations and
friends, who wish to attend and comfort them; and those who have
been used to live in plenty and even elegance, are reduced to deplorable
distress.</p>

<p>The general, further emulating his ministerial masters, by a proclamation
bearing date on the 12th day of June, after venting the
grossest falsehoods and calumnies against the good people of these
colonies, proceeds to “declare them all, either by name or description,
to be rebels and traitors, to supersede the course of the common
law, and instead thereof to publish and order the use and exercise
of the law martial.” His troops have butchered our countrymen,
have wantonly burnt Charlestown, besides a considerable number
of houses in other places; our ships and vessels are seized; the
necessary supplies of provisions are intercepted, and he is exerting
his utmost power to spread destruction and devastation around him.</p>

<p>We have received certain intelligence, that general Carleton, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">329</a></span>
governor of Canada, is instigating the people of that province, and
the Indians, to fall upon us; and we have but too much reason to
apprehend, that schemes have been formed to excite domestic enemies
against us. In brief, a part of these colonies now feel, and all
of them are sure of feeling, as far as the vengeance of administration
can inflict them, the complicated calamities of fire, sword and famine.
We are reduced to the alternative of choosing an unconditional submission
to the tyranny of irritated ministers, or resistance by force.
<em>The latter is our choice. We have counted the cost of this contest,
and find nothing so dreadful as voluntary slavery.</em> Honour, justice,
and humanity, forbid us tamely to surrender that freedom which we
received from our gallant ancestors, and which our innocent posterity
have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infamy and
guilt of resigning succeeding generations to that wretchedness which
inevitably awaits them, if we basely entail hereditary bondage upon
them.</p>

<p>Our cause is just. Our union is perfect. Our internal resources
are great, and, if necessary, foreign assistance is undoubtedly attainable.
We gratefully acknowledge, as a signal instance of the divine
favour towards us, that his providence would not permit us to be called
into this severe controversy until we were grown up to our present
strength, had been previously exercised in warlike operations, and
possessed the means of defending ourselves. With hearts fortified
with these animating reflections, we most solemnly before God and
the world <span class="smcap smaller">DECLARE</span>, that, exerting the utmost energy of those powers
which our beneficent Creator hath graciously bestowed upon us, the
arms we have been compelled by our enemies to assume, we will, in
defiance of every hazard, with unabating firmness and perseverance,
employ for the preservation of our liberties—<em>being with one mind resolved
to die</em> <span class="smcap smaller">FREEMEN</span> <em>rather than to live</em> <span class="smcap smaller">SLAVES</span>.</p>

<p>Lest this declaration should disquiet the minds of our friends and
fellow subjects in any part of the empire, we assure them that we
mean not to dissolve that union which has so long and so happily subsisted
between us, and which we sincerely wish to see restored. Necessity
has not yet driven us into that desperate measure, or induced
us to excite any other nation to war against them. We have not raised
armies with ambitious designs of separating from Great Britain and
establishing independent states. We fight not for glory or for conquest.
We exhibit to mankind the remarkable spectacle of a people
attacked by unprovoked enemies, without any imputation or even suspicion
of offence. They boast of their privileges and civilization, and
yet proffer no milder conditions than servitude or death.</p>

<p>In our own native land, in defence of the freedom that is our birthright,
and which we ever enjoyed till the late violation of it, for the
protection of our property, acquired solely by the honest industry of
our forefathers and ourselves, against violence actually offered, we
have taken up arms. We shall lay them down when hostilities shall
cease on the part of the aggressors, and all danger of their being renewed
shall be removed, and not before.</p>

<p>With an humble confidence in the mercies of the supreme and impartial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">330</a></span>
Judge and Ruler of the universe, we most devoutly implore his
divine goodness to protect us happily through this great conflict, to
dispose our adversaries to reconciliation on reasonable terms, and
thereby to relieve the empire from the calamities of civil war.</p>

<p>§ 2. The United States, in Congress assembled, shall also be the
last resort on appeal, in all disputes and differences now subsisting, or
that hereafter may arise between two or more states concerning boundary,
jurisdiction or any other cause whatever, which authority shall
always be exercised in the manner following: Whenever the legislative
or executive authority, or lawful agent of any state in controversy
with another, shall present a petition to Congress stating the matter
in question, and praying for a hearing, notice thereof shall be given
by order of Congress to the legislative or executive authority of the
other state in controversy, and a day assigned for the appearance of
the parties by their lawful agents, who shall then be directed to appoint,
by joint consent, commissioners or judges to constitute a court
for hearing and determining the matter in question; but if they cannot
agree, Congress shall name three persons out of each of the United
States, and from the list of such persons each party shall alternately
strike out one, the petitioners beginning, until the number shall be
reduced to thirteen; and from that number not less than seven, nor
more than nine names, as Congress shall direct, shall, in the presence
of Congress, be drawn out by lot; and the persons whose names shall
be so drawn, or any five of them, shall be commissioners or judges, to
hear and finally determine the controversy, so always as a major part
of the judges, who shall hear the cause, shall agree in the determination;
and if either party shall neglect to attend at the day appointed,
without showing reasons which Congress shall judge sufficient, or
being present, shall refuse to strike, the Congress shall proceed to nominate
three persons out of each state, and the secretary of Congress
shall strike in behalf of such party absent or refusing; and the judgment
and sentence of the court, to be appointed in the manner before
prescribed, shall be final and conclusive; and if any of the parties
shall refuse to submit to the authority of such court, or to appear or
defend their claim or cause, the court shall nevertheless proceed to
pronounce sentence or judgment, which shall in like manner be final
and decisive; the judgment or sentence and other proceedings being
in either case transmitted to Congress, and lodged among the acts of
Congress, for the security of the parties concerned; provided, that
every commissioner, before he sits in judgment, shall take an oath, to
be administered by one of the judges of the supreme or superior court
of the state where the cause shall be tried, “well and truly to hear
and determine the matter in question, according to the best of his
judgment, without favour, affection or hope of reward.” Provided also,
that no state shall be deprived of territory for the benefit of the United
States.</p>

<p>§ 3. All controversies concerning the private right of soil claimed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">334</a></span>
under different grants of two or more states, whose jurisdiction, as
they may respect such lands, and the states which passed such grants
are adjusted, the said grants or either of them being at the same time
claimed to have originated antecedent to such settlement of jurisdiction,
shall, on the petition of either party to the Congress of the United
States, be finally determined, as near as may be, in the same manner
as is before prescribed for deciding disputes respecting territorial jurisdiction
between different states.</p>

<p>§ 4. The United States, in Congress assembled, shall also have the
sole and exclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value
of coin struck by their own authority, or by that of the respective
states; fixing the standard of weights and measures throughout the
United States; regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the
Indians, not members of any of the states; provided that the legislative
right of any state, within its own limits, be not infringed or violated;
establishing and regulating post offices from one state to another,
throughout all the United States, and exacting such postage on
the papers passing through the same as may be requisite to defray
the expenses of the said office; appointing all officers of the land forces
in the service of the United States, excepting regimental officers; appointing
all the officers of the naval forces, and commissioning all
officers whatever in the service of the United States; making rules
for the government and regulation of the said land and naval forces,
and directing their operations.</p>

<p>§ 5. The United States, in Congress assembled, shall have authority
to appoint a committee, to sit in the recess of Congress, to be denominated,
“<i>A Committee of the States</i>,” and to consist of one delegate
from each state; and to appoint such other committees and civil
officers as may be necessary for managing the general affairs of the
United States under their direction; to appoint one of their number
to preside; provided that no person be allowed to serve in the office
of president more than one year in any term of three years; to ascertain
the necessary sums of money to be raised for the service of the
United States, and to appropriate and apply the same for defraying
the public expenses; to borrow money or emit bills on the credit of
the United States, transmitting every half year to the respective states
an account of the sums of money so borrowed or emitted; to build
and equip a navy; to agree upon the number of land forces, and to
make requisitions from each state for its quota, in proportion to the
number of white inhabitants in such state, which requisition shall be
binding; and thereupon the legislature of each state shall appoint the
regimental officers, raise the men, clothe, arm, and equip them, in a
soldier-like manner, at the expense of the United States; and the
officers and men so clothed, armed, and equipped, shall march to the
place appointed, and within the time agreed on by the United States,
in Congress assembled; but if the United States, in Congress assembled,
shall, on consideration of circumstances, judge proper that any
state should not raise men, or should raise a smaller number than its
quota, and that any other state should raise a greater number of men
than the quota thereof, such extra number shall be raised, officered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">335</a></span>
clothed, armed, and equipped in the same manner as the quota of such
state, unless the legislature of such state shall judge that such extra
number cannot be safely spared out of the same, in which case they
shall raise, officer, clothe, arm, and equip as many of such extra number
as they judge can be safely spared, and the officers and men so
clothed, armed, and equipped, shall march to the place appointed,
and within the time agreed on by the United States in Congress assembled.</p>

<p>§ 6. The United States, in Congress assembled, shall never engage
in a war, nor grant letters of marque and reprisal in time of peace,
nor enter into any treaties or alliances, nor coin money, nor regulate
the value thereof, nor ascertain the sums and expenses necessary for
the defence and welfare of the United States, or any of them, nor emit
bills, nor borrow money on the credit of the United States, nor appropriate
money, nor agree upon the number of vessels of war to be built
or purchased, or the number of land or sea forces to be raised, nor appoint
a commander-in-chief of the army or navy, unless nine states
assent to the same, nor shall a question on any other point, except for
adjourning from day to day, be determined, unless by the votes of a
majority of the United States in Congress assembled.</p>

<p>§ 7. The Congress of the United States shall have power to adjourn
to any time within the year, and to any place within the United States,
so that no period of adjournment be for a longer duration than the space
of six months, and shall publish the journal of their proceedings
monthly, except such parts thereof relating to treaties, alliances, or
military operations, as in their judgment require secrecy; and the
yeas and nays of the delegates of each state, on any question shall be
entered on the journal, when it is desired by any delegate; and the
delegates of a state, or any of them, at his or their request, shall be
furnished with a transcript of the said journal, except such parts as
are above excepted, to lay before the legislatures of the several states.</p>

<p>Art. 10. The committee of the states, or any nine of them, shall be
authorized to execute, in the recess of Congress, such of the powers
of Congress as the United States, in Congress assembled, by the consent
of nine states, shall, from time to time, think expedient to vest
them with; provided that no power be delegated to the said committee,
for the exercise of which, by the articles of confederation, the
voice of nine states, in the Congress of the United States assembled,
is requisite.</p>

<p>Art. 11. Canada acceding to this confederation, and joining in the
measures of the United States, shall be admitted into, and entitled to
all the advantages of this Union: but no other colony shall be admitted
into the same, unless such admission be agreed to by nine states.</p>

<p>Art. 12. All bills of credit emitted, moneys borrowed, and debts
contracted by or under the authority of Congress, before the assembling
of the United States, in pursuance of the present confederation,
shall be deemed and considered as a charge against the United States,
for payment and satisfaction whereof the said United States and the
public faith are hereby solemnly pledged.</p>

<p>Art. 13. Every state shall abide by the determination of the United<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span>
States, in Congress assembled, in all questions which, by this confederation,
are submitted to them. And the articles of this confederation
shall be inviolably observed by every state, and the Union shall be
perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in
any of them, unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the
United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislature of every
state.</p>

<p>And whereas it hath pleased the Great Governor of the world to
incline the hearts of the legislatures we respectively represent in Congress,
to approve of, and to authorize us to ratify the said articles of
confederation and perpetual union, Know ye, that we, the undersigned
delegates, by virtue of the power and authority to us given for that
purpose, do, by these presents, in the name and in behalf of our respective
constituents, fully and entirely ratify and confirm each and
every of the said articles of confederation and perpetual union, and
all and singular the matters and things therein contained. And we do
further solemnly plight and engage the faith of our respective constituents,
that they shall abide by the determination of the United States,
in Congress assembled, in all questions which by the said confederation
are submitted to them; and that the articles thereof shall be
inviolably observed by the states we respectively represent, and that
the Union shall be perpetual. In witness whereof, we have hereunto
set our hands, in Congress.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_63">CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.</h2>
</div>

<h3><span class="smaller">PREAMBLE.</span></h3>

<p>We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect
union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for
the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the
blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish
this constitution for the United States of America.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE I.<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>Of the Legislature.</i></span></h3>

<h4>SECTION I.</h4>

<p>1. All legislative powers herein granted, shall be vested in a congress
of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House
of Representatives.</p>

<h4>SECTION II.</h4>

<p>1. The House of Representatives shall be composed of members
chosen every second year by the people of the several states; and the
electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors
of the most numerous branch of the state legislature.</p>

<p>2. No person shall be a representative who shall not have attained
to the age of twenty-five years, and been seven years a citizen of the
United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of
that state in which he shall be chosen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">338</a></span>
3. Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the
several states which may be included within this union, according to
their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the
whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a
term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other
persons. The actual enumeration shall be made within three years
after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within
every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by
law direct. The number of representatives shall not exceed one for
every thirty thousand, but each state shall have at least one representative;
and until such enumeration shall be made, the state of <i>New
Hampshire</i> shall be entitled to choose three; <i>Massachusetts</i> eight;
<i>Rhode Island and Providence Plantations</i> one; <i>Connecticut</i> five;
<i>New York</i> six; <i>New Jersey</i> four; <i>Pennsylvania</i> eight; <i>Delaware</i>
one; <i>Maryland</i> six; <i>Virginia</i> ten; <i>North Carolina</i> five; <i>South
Carolina</i> five; and <i>Georgia</i> three.</p>

<p>4. When vacancies happen in the representation from any state,
the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill up
such vacancies.</p>

<p>5. The House of Representatives shall choose their speaker and
other officers, and shall have the sole power of impeachment.</p>

<h4>SECTION III.</h4>

<p>1. The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two senators
from each state, chosen by the legislature thereof, for six years;
and each senator shall have one vote.</p>

<p>2. Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the
first election, they shall be divided, as equally as may be, into three
classes. The seats of the senators of the first class shall be vacated at
the expiration of the second year, of the second class at the expiration
of the fourth year, and of the third class at the expiration of the sixth
year, so that one third may be chosen every second year; and if
vacancies happen, by resignation or otherwise, during the recess of
the legislature of any state, the executive thereof may make temporary
appointments until the next meeting of the legislature, which
shall then fill such vacancies.</p>

<p>3. No person shall be a senator who shall not have attained to the
age of thirty years, and been nine years a citizen of the United States,
and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state for
which he shall be chosen.</p>

<p>4. The Vice President of the United States shall be President of
the Senate, but shall have no vote, unless they be equally divided.</p>

<p>5. The Senate shall choose their other officers, and also a president
pro tempore, in the absence of the Vice President, or when he shall
exercise the office of President of the United States.</p>

<p>6. The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.
When sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation.
When the President of the United States is tried, the chief justice
shall preside; and no person shall be convicted without the concurrence
of two-thirds of the members present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>
7. Judgment in case of impeachment shall not extend further than
to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any
office of honour, trust, or profit, under the United States; but the
party convicted shall, nevertheless, be liable and subject to indictment,
trial, judgment, and punishment according to law.</p>

<h4>SECTION IV.</h4>

<p>1. The times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators
and representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature
thereof; but the Congress may at any time, by law, make or
alter such regulations, except as to the place of choosing senators.</p>

<p>2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and
such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they
shall by law appoint a different day.</p>

<h4>SECTION V.</h4>

<p>1. Each House shall be the judge of the elections, returns, and
qualifications of its own members; and a majority of each shall constitute
a quorum to do business; but a smaller number may adjourn
from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the attendance of
absent members, in such manner and under such penalties as each
House may provide.</p>

<p>2. Each House may determine the rule of its proceedings, punish
its members for disorderly behaviour, and, with the concurrence of
two-thirds, expel a member.</p>

<p>3. Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from
time to time publish the same, excepting such parts as may in their
judgment require secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the members of
either House, on any question, shall, at the desire of one-fifth of those
present, be entered on the journal.</p>

<p>4. Neither House during the session of Congress shall, without the
consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any
other place than that in which the two houses shall be sitting.</p>

<h4>SECTION VI.</h4>

<p>1. The senators and representatives shall receive a compensation
for their services, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the treasury
of the United States. They shall in all cases, except treason,
felony, and breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their
attendance at the session of their respective Houses, and in going to
or returning from the same; and for any speech or debate in either
House, they shall not be questioned in any other place.</p>

<p>2. No senator or representative shall, during the time for which he
was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of
the United States which shall have been created, or the emoluments
whereof shall have been increased, during such time; and no person
holding any office under the United States shall be a member of either
House during his continuance in office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span></p>

<h4>SECTION VII.</h4>

<p>1. All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives;
but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments,
as on other bills.</p>

<p>2. Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives
and the Senate shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President
of the United States; if he approve, he shall sign it; but if not,
he shall return it, with his objections, to that House in which it shall
have originated, who shall enter the objection at large on their journal,
and proceed to reconsider it. If, after such reconsideration, two-thirds
of that House shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together
with the objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be
reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of that House, it shall
become a law. But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall
be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting
for and against the bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House
respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the President
within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented
to him, the same shall be a law in like manner as if he had signed it,
unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which
case it shall not be a law.</p>

<p>3. Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the
Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary, (except a
question of adjournment,) shall be presented to the President of the
United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved
by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by
two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to
the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill.</p>

<h4>SECTION VIII.</h4>

<p> 1. To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay

<h3>ARTICLE II.<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>Of the Executive.</i></span></h3>

<h4>SECTION I.</h4>

<p>1. The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United
States of America. He shall hold his office during the term of four
years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same term,
be elected as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<p>2. Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof
may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of senators
and representatives to which the state may be entitled in Congress;
but no senator or representative, or person holding any office
of trust or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an
elector.</p>

<p>3. The electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by
ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant
of the same state with themselves. And they shall make a list of all
the persons voted for, and of the number of votes for each; which list
they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government
of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate.
The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and
House of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall
then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes
shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole
number of electors appointed; and if there be more than one who
have such majority, and have an equal number of votes, then the
House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of
them for President; and if no person have a majority, then, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>
the five highest on the list, the said House shall in like manner
choose the President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall
be taken by states, the representation from each state having one
vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members
from two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states
shall be necessary to a choice. In every case after the choice of the
President, the person having the greatest number of votes of the
electors shall be Vice President. But if there should remain two or
more who have equal votes, the Senate shall choose from them by
ballot the Vice President.</p>

<p>4. The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors
and the day on which they shall give their votes, which day shall be
the same throughout the United States.</p>

<p>5. No person except a natural-born citizen, or a citizen of the
United States at the time of the adoption of this constitution, shall
be eligible to the office of President; neither shall any person be eligible
to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty-five
years, and been fourteen years a resident within the United
States.</p>

<p>6. In case of the removal of the President from office, or of his
death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of
the said office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President; and
the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death,
resignation, or inability, both of the President and Vice President,
declaring what officer shall then act as President; and such officer
shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed or a President
shall be elected.</p>

<p>7. The President shall, at stated times, receive for his services a
compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during
the period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not
receive within that period any other emolument from the United
States, or any of them.</p>

<p>8. Before he enter on the execution of his office, he shall take the
following oath or <span class="locked">affirmation:—</span></p>

<p>“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the
office of President of the United States, and will, to the best of my
ability, preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the United
States.”</p>

<h4>SECTION II.</h4>

<p>1. The President shall be commander-in-chief of the army and
navy of the United States and of the militia of the several states,
when called into the actual service of the United States; he may require
the opinion in writing of the principal officer in each of the
executive departments, upon any subject relating to the duties of
their respective offices; and he shall have power to grant reprieves
and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases
of impeachment.</p>

<p>2. He shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the senators present,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>
concur: and he shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent
of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers
and consuls, judges of the supreme court, and all other officers of the
United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided
for, and which shall be established by law. But the Congress may
by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think
proper in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of
departments.</p>

<p>3. The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may
happen during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions,
which shall expire at the end of the next session.</p>

<h4>SECTION III.</h4>

<p>1. He shall, from time to time, give to Congress information of
the state of the Union, and recommend to their consideration such
measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on
extraordinary occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them; and
in case of disagreement between them, with respect to the time of
adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think
proper; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers; he
shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed; and shall commission
all the officers of the United States.</p>

<h4>SECTION IV.</h4>

<p>1. The President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United
States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction
of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE III.<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>Of the Judiciary.</i></span></h3>

<h4>SECTION I.</h4>

<p>1. The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one
Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as Congress may, from
time to time order and establish. The judges, both of the supreme
and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour; and
shall, at stated times, receive for their services a compensation, which
shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.</p>

<h4>SECTION II.</h4>

<p>1. The judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity
arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and
treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to all

<p id="hdr_65"><i>The following is the original copy of the Declaration of Independence
as written by Thomas Jefferson. The part printed with quotations

<p class="p1 center larger"><span class="smcap">A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of
America in General Congress assembled.</span></p>

<p>When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with
another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate
and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature’s God
entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind, requires
that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p>

<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with [certain] “inherent
and” unalienable rights; that amongst these are, life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are
instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of
the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive
of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to
abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundation
on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them
shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence,
indeed, will dictate, that governments long established, should not be
changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience
hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while
evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms
to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and
usurpations, “begun at a distinguished period and” pursuing invariably
the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute
despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government,
and to provide new guards to their future security. Such has
been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity
which constrains them to [alter] “expunge” their former systems
of government.</p>

<p>The history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of [repeated]
“unremitting” injuries and usurpations, “among which appears
no solitary fact to contradict the uniform tenor of the rest; but
all have” [all having,] in direct object, the establishment of an absolute
tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted
to a candid world, “for the truth of which we pledge a faith yet unsullied
by falsehood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">351</a></span>
He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary
for the public good.</p>

<p>He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing
importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent
should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected
to attend to them.</p>

<p>He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large
districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of
representation in the legislature, a right inestimable to them and
formidable to tyrants only.</p>

<p>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable,
and distant from the depository of their public records, for
the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p>

<p>He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly “and continually,”
for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the
people.</p>

<p>He has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause
others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of
annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise;
the state remaining in the mean time exposed to all the danger of invasion
from without, and convulsions within.</p>

<p>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these states; for
that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners, refusing
to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising
the conditions of new appropriations of lands.</p>

<p>He has “suffered” [obstructed] the administration of justice “totally
to cease in some of these states,” [by] refusing his assent to
laws for establishing judiciary powers.</p>

<p>He has made “our” judges dependent on his will alone for the
tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.</p>

<p>He has erected a multitude of new offices, “by a self-assumed
power,” and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and
eat out their substance.</p>

<p>He has kept among us in times of peace standing armies, “and
ships of war,” without the consent of our legislatures.</p>

<p>He has affected to render the military independent of and superior
to the civil power.</p>

<p>He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign
to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his
assent to their acts of pretended legislation.</p>

<p>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p>

<p>For protecting them, by mock trial, from punishment for any murders
which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states:</p>

<p>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</p>

<p>For imposing taxes on us without our consent:</p>

<p>For depriving us, [in many cases,] of the benefits of trial by jury:</p>

<p>For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences:</p>

<p>For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighbouring
province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging
its boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">352</a></span>
for introducing the same absolute rule into these “states” [colonies:]</p>

<p>For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws,
and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments:</p>

<p>For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested
with power to legislate for us, in all cases whatever:</p>

<p>He has abdicated government here “withdrawing his governors,
and” [by] declaring us out of his [allegiance] protection, [and
waging war against us:]</p>

<p>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns,
and destroyed the lives of our people:</p>

<p>He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries
to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun
with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy, [scarcely paralleled in the
most barbarous ages, and] totally unworthy the head of a civilized
nation.</p>

<p>The three next paragraphs in the original draught, were as follows:</p>

<p>“He has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers
the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished
destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions of existence.</p>

<p>“He has incited treasonable insurrections of our fellow-citizens,
with the allurements of forfeiture and confiscation of our property.</p>

<p>“He has constrained others, taken captives on the high seas, to bear
arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends
and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.”</p>

<p>In place of the three paragraphs erased, the two following were introduced:</p>

<p>[He has constrained our fellow-citizens taken captive on the high
seas, to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of
their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.]</p>

<p>[He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured
to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless
Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished
destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.]</p>

<p>The next paragraph, which related to the slave trade, was entirely
erased. It was as follows:</p>

<p>“He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its
most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people,
who never offended him, captivating and carrying them into slavery,
in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation
thither. This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers,
is the warfare of a Christian king of Great Britain. Determined to
keep open a market where <span class="bold">MEN</span> should be bought and sold, he has
prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to
prohibit or restrain this execrable commerce; and that this assemblage
of horrors might want no fact of distinguished dye, he is now exciting
those very people to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that
liberty of which he has deprived them, by murdering the people upon
whom he also obtruded them; thus paying off former crimes committed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">353</a></span>
against the liberties of one people, with crimes which he urges
them to commit against the lives of another.”</p>

<p>In every stage of these oppressions, we have petitioned for redress
in the most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered
only by repeated injury. A prince whose character is thus marked
by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a
[free] people “who mean to be free. Future ages will scarce believe
that the hardiness of one man adventured within the short compass of
twelve years only, to build a foundation so broad and undisguised, for
tyranny over a people fostered and fixed in principles of freedom.”</p>

<p>Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren.
We have warned them from time to time, of attempts by their legislature
“to extend a jurisdiction over these our states,” [to extend an
unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.] We have reminded them of the
circumstances of our emigration and settlement here, “no one of which
could warrant so strange a pretension: that these were effected at the
expense of our own blood and treasure, unassisted by the wealth or
the strength of Great Britain: that in constituting indeed our several
forms of government, we had adopted one common king, thereby laying
a foundation for perpetual league and amity with them: but that
submission to their parliament was no part of our constitution, nor
ever in idea, if history may be credited; and” we [have] appealed to
their native justice and magnanimity, “as well as to” [and we have
assured them by] the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these
usurpations, which “were likely to” [would inevitably] interrupt our
connexions and correspondence. They too, have been deaf to the
voice of justice and of consanguinity; “and when occasions have been
given them by the regular course of their laws, of removing from their
councils, the disturbers of our harmony, they have by their free election
re-established them in power. At this very time too, they are
permitting their chief magistrate to send over not only soldiers of our
common blood, but [Scotch and] foreign mercenaries to invade and
destroy us. These facts have given the last stab to agonizing affection;
and manly spirit bids us to renounce forever these unfeeling
brethren. We must endeavour to forget our former love for them,
and to hold them as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in
peace friends. We might have been a free and a great people together;
but a communication of grandeur and of freedom it seems, is
below their dignity. Be it so, since they will have it. The road to
happiness and to glory is open to us too: we will climb it apart from
them, and acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our eternal
separation.” [We must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which
denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind,
enemies in war, in peace friends.]</p>

<p>We, therefore, the representatives of the <i>United States of America,
in General Congress assembled</i>, [appealing to the supreme
judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions] do, in the name,
and by authority of the good people of these “states [colonies,] reject
and renounce all allegiance and subjection to the kings of Great Britain,
and all others, who may hereafter claim by, through, or under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">354</a></span>
them; we utterly dissolve all political connexion which may heretofore
have subsisted between us and the parliament of Great Britain;
and finally we do assert” [solemnly publish and declare] That
these United Colonies are, [and of right ought to be,] free and independent
states; [that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British
crown, and that all political connexion between them and the state
of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved,] and that as
free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude
peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other
acts and things which independent states may of right do. And for
the support of this Declaration, [with a firm reliance on Divine Providence,]
we mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our fortunes,
and our sacred honour.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
